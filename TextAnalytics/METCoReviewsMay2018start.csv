5/1/2018,2626-20,M18™ Cordless Multi-Tool (Tool Only),"We normally use our corded fein, but we had a large flooring job, lots of architrave to cut in. So I borrowed a mates Milwaukee cordless. All our cordless gear is Milwaukee, so batteries weren't an issue. Ran great, it has enough weight in the tool to deliver clean precision cuts. Cut through 100s of meters of 19mm tas oak architraves no problems. Only one little issue balance was a little off when using 9 amp battery. But that said your not dragging a cord around either. Will definitely be adding one to my stack. Keep your blades sharp and your batteries charged. Australian hardwoods will test any tool.",5
5/2/2018,2725-21HD,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer Kit,I have a 2.8 acre lot with a long ditch running the length of the side and front. I go for hours on end running this and I love it. I have 3 9ah batteries and they come pretty close to doing the work without any recharge. I will advise however use only .080 string as the battery will turn off to prevent overheating with heavier string. The battery swaps are way faster and safer than refueling too.,5

5/3/2018,6130-33,"7.0 AMP 4-1/2"" Small Angle Grinder",I bought this grinder brand to when welding on my boat. The on/off switch is sometimes hard to lock in the on position. Also while grinding it is to easy to hit the the switch and shut it off. It made the job very frustrating. I would gladly give this tool away!,2
5/4/2018,48-22-9016,17oz Milled Face Framing Hammer,I recently bought this hammer and it's great. I like it's made half with fiberglass makes it weigh less.,5
5/4/2018,2772A-20,M18 FUEL™ Drain Snake with CABLE-DRIVE™ Locking Feed System,So as a plumber the M18 Drain snake is a top piece of equipment to have. It saves on time in set up and in time to clear drains. The 3/8 cable with different heads is my cable of choice. The 1/4 cable was one thing that needs work. It bent and broke on me. Over all I highly recommend this to all plumbers. I also bought this tool on my own for my plumbing truck and have now even gotten my boss to buy one to try on other trucks. Keep it up Milwaukee. Great Job! Can't wait to purchase the switch pack next!,5
5/4/2018,2743-20,M18 FUEL™ 15ga Finish Nailer (Tool Only),When I bought the product I used it and it was having problems I sent it in to have it fixed I received it back up about two weeks later and it still was not working any better it Chatters without firing almost every time I can release it and try again and then it will fire,1
5/4/2018,2446-20,M12™ Cordless LITHIUM-ION Grease Gun (Tool Only),"I have several M12 tools so I bought this grease gun as an addition to my set.  I do not need a three foot hose on it, but when I went to change to a shorter hose I bought at my local hardware I discovered the threading does not match.  For some reason Milwaukee has put a different thread on this units hose attachment.",1
5/5/2018,2106,Alk Headlamp,"The brightness of the lamp is amazing, the headband is perfect.  BUT, the plastic casing for the headlamp is of the worst quality possible.  It breaks around the hinges in less than two weeks and it has happened to me 3 times and to a couple of friends at least once each.  I was the only one who went and bought a second one because I figured maybe we got a bad batch in this area, but no they still break the same.  I'm not talking letting a 5 year old play with it and then it breaks.  I'm talking put it on my head and just the normal wear and tear that would take years to break a cheap no brand headlamp kills this lamp in two weeks.  Milwaukee needs to remedy this because for $40.00 I would expect a lot more quality and endurance out of a Milwaukee tool.",1

5/6/2018,2364-20,M12™ Compact Flood Light,"I've had this for a couple of months now and it never ceases to amaze me when I turn it on. I work night shifts so it's always dark and measuring and cutting material is way nice with this thing, I usually just use the magnets and stick it to my work truck (it holds it weight surprisingly well) and work away as if it were the middle of the day. I also rock climb at night a lot and this thing lights up a whole climbing wall easy whether I put it on the ground or clip it to a rope and let if hang off the top of the cliff (looks about as bright as a street lamp) it does it's job perfectly. And with the big batteries it always lasts several hours on full blast. One of my favorite buys especially for the price.",5

5/7/2018,49-40-6110,Cutting Dust Shroud,Just got my grinder back from repairs I work in the stone industry doing granite and stone counters as a contractor I need to be osha compliant on the job site I supply my own tools just because and when my grinder finally cane in today the shroud does not fit?!??!!. All my other tools are obviously not as important as this one as I use this to make adjustments on site.,1

I'm glade I waited before buying other table saw",5
5/7/2018,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I purchased this blower to replace my old corded unit.  I was thrilled when I saw it on the Milwaukee site, I've got a bunch of M18 tools, so I only need to purchase the tool.  This blower has plenty of power, and as long as you keep extra batteries around, it will handle any household job.  The unit is lite enough to be comfortable to carry, I prefer to use the smaller batteries as the larger ones add extra weight, I don't mind changing the batteries a bit more.",5

5/7/2018,2111-21,USB Rechargeable Hard Hat Headlamp,"I am a shift fitter so especially  useful on night shift, and well set up for using on safety helmet with the plastic clips. Omly downside is I would like a separate charger so I can have a battery ready to chnge when it goes flat.",5

5/8/2018,2353-20,M12™ Spot Light,I love this little spot light!! So small and compact i can keep it in my vehicle all the times for a spotting emergence =) with the 6.0ah battery in you can use it for a very long time. Tough little booger too! Dropped the thing quite a few times and still works. Good for the job site or recreational use!,5
5/9/2018,48-22-8426,PACKOUT™ Rolling Tool Box,"Handles all my tools very strong, handle is great     a second tool tray would be a nice option",5
5/9/2018,2810-20,M18 FUEL™ Mud Mixer with 180° Handle (Tool Only),"I have been a professional tile setter and general contractor for over thirty year now and have to say that this mud mixer from Milwaukee is an innovation that actually makes working out in the field easier. The motor is plenty powerful for handling anything I have already thrown at it and believe me, I was not kind to it. I don't abuse my tools but they have to work, and I have to know that they will work consistently. This mixer does it in spades. All the guts and quality of a Milwaukee tool without the flare the pretty boys want. Dirty, gritty, and it works....exactly what I want from my Milwaukee collection.",5
5/9/2018,2755B-20,"M18 FUEL™ 1/2"" Compact Impact Wrench w/ Friction Ring (Bare Tool)",i have been a mechanic for over 30 years and have owned many cordless impacts. the milwakee is the most powerful one by far. i bought the 3/8 one first when my makita wore out. i liked it so much i also purchased the 1/2 and i use it more than my air powered ingersol rand impact. milwakee has made some of the best electric tools for as long as i can remember i have lots of them and they all still work like new and they are all over 20 years old. now the battery powered tools are the same quality. thanks milwakee tool.,5
5/9/2018,2743-21CT,M18 FUEL™ 15ga Finish Nailer Kit,"I am a DIYer and have some work to do in a large church facility that this nailer will be a big part of.  I have only used it on a couple of smaller jobs but so far this beauty is really nice and consistent. I've had zero jams, zero overheat shutdowns and after some use in familiarizing myself with it haven't had any nails not fully sink.  At first I had a couple proud of the surface but that was due to my not controlling the kickback, these things are powerful!  It could probably be improved for getting into corners but I'm not sure how much, it is just a flaw for all of these types of nailers, it certainly does as well as most of the competition.  I am completely satisfied with the form and function of the unit and look forward to the day Milwaukee produces an M18 framing nailer because I will be running to the store to get my very own!",5
5/9/2018,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BATTERY TRIMMERS AND TOOLS BUT AFTER USING THIS MILWAUKEE TRIMMER IS VERY POWERFUL AND DOES A GREAT JOB .!!
I HAVE THE 9.0 BATTERY AND ALSO THE 5.0 THE TRIMMER DOES NOT EAT UP BATTERY LIFE I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT .
BLOWER ALSO WORKS GREAT THAT YOU NEED THE 9.0 BATTERY",5
5/9/2018,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Have a couple of Milwaukee drills and spare batteries which have always worked great.  Needed an edger for brush clearance and this fit the bill.  Battery last for about an hour with continuous use.  Takes about an hour and a half to fully recharge.  Used it for 7 days straight clearing the brush on our hill.  Ate through tall grass and mustard weed with ease.  Only problem I had was we have very loose dirt and had to find a big rock or walk out to the deck or street to advance out some line.  NO FAULT OF THE TOOL.!!  Just an inconvenience of where I live.  Assembly of the tool was easy and balanced real nice.  Swings easy and after seven days straight, didn't feel like my arms would fall off.  Starts up quick and spools down quickly too.  Holding the buttons for an hour at a time is easy too as it fits well in the hand.  Overall, I'd highly recommend it to anyone.",5
5/10/2018,48-32-5032,"SHOCKWAVE™ 1/4"" Hex to 1/2"" Square Socket Adapter",I have broken 3 of these adapters in the last week they are a horrible design flaw I do not raddle nuts with them I use them and a socket to spin open and close clamps and the sheer off as a lineman in gloves and sleeves in the Florida sun its quite a set back having to retrieve my socket that just fell 40ft I love Milwaukee products but this is horrible,1
5/10/2018,48-22-8210,Jobsite Tech Bag,"It has more than enough storage to fit all of your tools, testing equipment, m12, or m18 tools. It has really good weight distribution so it doesn't feel very heavy even when you load it with a lot of stuff. The rain guard is also really handy for people working outside.",5
5/10/2018,2864-20,"M18 FUEL™ w/ ONE-KEY™ High Torque Impact Wrench 3/4"" Friction Ring Bare Tool","This tool is amazing, I've been using Milwaukee Tools for about four years now. I've got everything from the stylist to the new One-Key 3/4"" high torque impact. I love my old 3/4 inch impact and when I heard of the this new one I jumped on it. The customization is insane, even though I'm the only one who would use my tools if you are a contractor I think you would love it more. Being able to customize four different profiles on the tool from torque range to speed and even how long the work light stays on this thing is a beast. Add the fact that you can track your tool with gps and even turn your tool off from your phone. Do your self a favor and start seeing Red!",5

5/10/2018,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","The innovation Milwaukee posses is apparent once again, what a surprise! I was astonished to not feel hear and smell of a screaming gas powered chainsaw as I chewed through the trunk of a cedar. They weren't joking when they put their name up to the comparison. Truly just a reminder that the innovation they will continue to crank out year after year.",5
5/10/2018,2680-20,"M18™ Cordless 4-1/2"" Cut-off / Grinder (Tool Only)","I love Milwaukee tools. I own a lot of corded and cordless versions. Some are 20+ yrs old and work perfectly. This was my first disappointment. Realistically, this tool shouldn't even be produced with The Milwaukee name on it. Buy the 4.5""  Fuel grinder for the extra money. This guy can't run a 4.5""  disc that has any weight to it without burning through the battery (the big extended version) in under 7 min.",2
5/11/2018,49-56-7250,"Large Thread Quick Change Arbor, 3/8""","I have had excellent results with the smaller hole saws on the fixed arbor. Recently I bought a 1 3/8 hole saw and had to buy the larger slide arbor. This was a disaster. The hole saw screwed down within a half turn of bottoming out, and the drive pins engaged properly. But the hole saw is still wobbly on the arbor. I cut a hole in 16 gauge steel and got a very messy cut, larger than the 1 3/8 with ragged edges. The saw was obviously loose on the shaft and described a wide ragged cut rather than the clean cuts I am used to with the fixed smaller arbor that screws down tight. This looks like a poor design to me. I recall an older model with a hex nut that tightened up behind the drive pins. Do I have a defective arbor or am I doing something wrong ?? I would certainly not buy this again.",2
5/11/2018,2763-20,"M18 FUEL™ 1/2"" High Torque Impact Wrench with Friction Ring (Bare Tool)","I am a mechanic tech in the oil and gas industry, our shop is ruled by these impact guns because of how well they work. I have had my gun for almost 8 months now and it works as good as it did new. I checked the torque vs a freshly recalibrated 3/4 drive torque wrench and maxed the torque wrench out at 600 ftlbs.",5
5/11/2018,2704-20,"M18 FUEL™ 1/2"" Hammer Drill/Driver (Tool Only)",Milwaukee 2897-22cx.Excellent tool at a great price .This drill combo is the best drill combo that I have ever owned! The battery lasts a long time!,5
5/12/2018,2717-20,"M18 FUEL™ 1-9/16"" SDS Max Hammer Drill (Tool Only)","I have used this drill to put in 6 concrete anchors with a 2"" depth. An extremely frustrating experience. The drill would not hammer off the start and once it does start hammering the trigger needs to be feathered. A task that should take 5 min took 30. I have used cordless Hilti and Bosch and both perform way better than this. 
It only received one star because I am required too.",1
5/12/2018,2475-21XC,M12™ Compact Inflator kit,"I purchased this product specifically with the hopes that I could use it to air up my tires after off roading, but alas Milwaukee has finally let me down. It failed to inflate a 33x12.5R15 tire. Using the bigger then supplied 4 amp hour battery and set to 35psi it took 2 minutes 52 seconds to inflat from 0 psi to 15 psi, then with out stopping the unit it only made it 32.5 psi be for the battery died and it shuts off @ 10 minutes and 43 seconds. Even if it had managed to reach 35 psi that would be over 40 minutes to fill 4 LT tires, not the 16 minutes as advertised. It will work ok in a pinch but I'm gonna need a a lot more batteries.",2
5/14/2018,49-56-0320,Adjustable Hole Cutter,"worked great on the small 2"" led can lights but when cutting 5/8 drywall fully extended I bent the adjusting arms now its useless. I have many Milwaukee tools and never had one fail.",2
5/31/2018,2853-20,"M18 FUEL™ 1/4"" Hex Impact Driver (Tool Only)",This impact is by far the best I ever used. Truly impressive !,5
5/31/2018,2110-21,USB Rechargeable 700L Flashlight,"I use this to inspect vehicles and components, while the beam pattern is nice it seams a bit muted and not because of the ""frosted"" plastic lens which is a plus to have while inspecting reflective components, however the power output doesn't seem to be what is advertised. The biggest downfall of this flashlight is the battery, I have only used and charged it a handful of times in the past 6 months because of the lack of battery life and failure for the battery to retain a charge for more than 2 days when I first got it, and now barely at all. The adjustable focus does not function that well either, suction effect pulls it back or pushes the lens forwards on its own. I may have received one with a defective battery like every other reviewer as well as a co-worker of mine. Wish I returned it to Home Depot 2 weeks after I got it and got my $$$ back  Overpriced, Non-Reliable, Much better options on the market. For the record this item has been very lightly used, never dropped and very well taken care of since day 1 (as in charged to full before first use). Bottom line myself and a few other friends would NOT recommend this flashlight to anyone until Milwaukee can work the ""bugs out of it.",2
5/31/2018,2734-20,M18 FUEL™ Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw,I use this saw every day at work doing wood siding and trim and balconies on commercial properties. With the 9.0 battery the saw will cut all day with plenty of power. It’s light weight and and easily loaded by one guy. Not having to roll out power saves time and can move on-site with no problems.,5
6/1/2018,2645-20,M18™ Jig Saw (Tool Only),"I bought this tool recently, it has lots of power and it works very well except that the plastic cover around the blade obstructs the users visibility too much so I just removed it. Also the plastic blade guide is held in place by two tiny little tabs which broke off and it no longer stays in place. Tool still works fine but this defect needs to be addressed before I would recommend purchasing it.",3
6/1/2018,2863-20,"M18 FUEL™ w/ ONE-KEY™ High Torque Impact Wrench 1/2"" Friction Ring (Tool Only)",I SOLD MY 2767-20 TO BUY THIS BECAUSE IM A MECHANIC AND WANTED TO PROGRAM LUGNUT TORQUE WITH THE ONE KEY APP. TURNS OUT YOU CAN ONLY CONTROLL SPEED AND NOT TORQUE. KINDA POINTLESS IN MY OPINION FOR AN IMPACT GUN..DONT SPEND THE EXTRA CASH UNLESS THEY FIX THE SETTINGS,3

6/2/2018,2701-20,"M18™ 1/2"" Compact Brushless Drill/Driver (Tool Only)","General construction.
I use to use exclusively Milwalkie, I even convinced my job site to switch from DeWalt because my Milwalke tools were awesome. It's been less than a year and 2 of the 4 drill chucks are already toasted. They won't release well and then will release the bit at random every 3 or four holes. The circular saw is a joke, underpowered and eats batteries like a hungry fat lady at McDonald's! The Jig Saw plate will un-snug its self in the middle of a cut and go from 90 degrees to whatever it chooses. I am thoroughly embarrassed that I convinced my boss to switch to your brand.  Our DeWalt line is ancient and EVERY SINGLE ONE of those tools are old, beat up but STILL WORK! My older set of Milwalkie drills I personally own had no issues but the new ones are G A R B A G E! I will NEVER buy Milwalkie again. You can rest assured your recent quality shortcomings are not going unnoticed or untold. Going back to Dewalt.",1

6/4/2018,48-22-8110,Electricians Work Belt,"I was excited to get my Milwaukee Electricians bags. I am a Milwaukee guy and I love pretty much every product I buy. I use these bags daily and tool up to the fullest. These bags are great and well thought out in their design with one flaw... If the pouches are full they will weigh down and the bottom inside edge of the pouches will rub on my legs all day long. It will get to the point where it hurts since the material is so tough, and makes something as simple as walking with the bags on somewhat painful. To remedy this I duct taped some padding on the bottom edges. This is really the only issue I have with this product or else it would get a 5 star rating.",3

6/5/2018,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I bought this product because of the name and it is battery operated.  At my age it was getting very difficult to start the gas trimmer so I thought I would give this a try and I am happy with the performance of the trimmer. My only drawback is a brush blade to make it faster to cut the brush.  It does the job in the brush but it takes a little longer and I am not getting any younger....heheheh,5
6/5/2018,2740-20,M18 FUEL™ 18ga Brad Nailer (Tool Only),"This tool has many good qualities, but there are some key points that if fixed by Milwaukee, could make this a top of the line tool. I am a custom millwork and finish carpentry/cabinetry installer, full time. The tool fires fast and has setting for quick fire. No wind up is very nice. Little heavy but for cordless it’s a great trade up still, it has an ok feel.    
    The issues I have with it are: 
- the nailer pin, is wide and leaves a big dent in finished product.
-the nose of the gun is bulky and not slim, making angles hard to get nicely. 
- it also doesn’t set nails very well at all ( without damaging material). If you aren’t 90 degrees it likely won’t set. 

These issues made me have to return it and switch back to paslode, if Milwaukee adjusted these issues, which shouldn’t be hard for a high quality company, I would happily try their next version. Until then I would let this one stay on the shelf. They got a lot of things right with it. Which is great for a first try at a finish carpentry tool. I believe they need to address these issues in order to make it a top of the line tool.",2
6/5/2018,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I bought this trimmer, because I was sick and tired of dealing with gas powered string trimmers, and I have bought 7 or 8 different ones that only last a couple of years or so, before they start having problems.  This trimmer works flawlessly for small grass and weed trimming, but for large, tall weeds, it is just not as powerful as I would like, even with using the 9.0 batteries, and they only last about 20 minutes, and it even works well with the 5.0 batteries I have.  So, I still need a gas powered trimmer for the big stuff.",4

6/7/2018,48-22-8430,PACKOUT™ Organizer,Im a Milwaukee Guy but this packout organizer is lacking the ability to stay closed tight. The hinges loosened up after 3 weeks of usage. This caused water to leak into the box. The regular organizer performed better than the packout.,1

Also charger is super quick have yet to have a battery die before another is charged. High gear is faster than any corded hole hawg I’ve ever owned before, (all Milwaukee as well) Very efficient for water lines. I love the tool.

The M12 offered an excellent price point for me, it has all the power i need, great additional tools that I’ll use the batteries for, excellent Milwaukee customer service and if there’s a tool in the 18V line that I want to pickup I know that I’ll have a charger that will work for both systems. No other brand has the compatibility that Milwaukee has and I really like that. I was able to carry this driver in my work pouch with the battery in my high viz vest an entire shift and pull it out when i needed to repair some stuff and it never weighed me down. The new M18 stuff coming out soon looks really promising and I think the heads are actually smaller but the battery and handle are still going to be bulky and large.

I am using it to assist in the refurbishment and renovation of an old church and find it to be a superb product! It sinks any nail that fits in it, it is small enough to be able to get into corners etc... The battery lasts a really long time, I use a 2.0Ah battery which keeps the nailer going and going while not adding much weight or size, it's a great combination. I have recommended this tool to my friends and those that have had a chance to try it all say they like it a lot.  The price is a bit high but sometimes (and in this particular case) you get what you pay for.  Kick-back (recoil) is pretty minimal, there will always be some on any product of this type but Milwaukee Engineers have done a great job of making it a non-issue, with just the bare minimum amount of effort you can easily control the recoil and by doing so this nailer will sink the nails flush or recessed every time.  Every nail I have put into this nailer has been sunk into wood, in fact I have never experienced a jam, not once (hundreds of nails shot).  I do purchase quality brand name nails I stay away from off/cheap bargain basement nails since I feel like if I used them I would be inviting trouble and aggravation.  Milwaukee please build a framing nailer that employs your awesome M18 system that would be awesome!",5
6/25/2018,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I bought this as a kit (Model # 2725-21HD-2726-20) with the string trimmer and the Hedge trimmer.  I didn't really want the Hedge Trimmer, but it is awesome if not a little heavy.  I bought the kit for the trimmer, and I am not impressed.  I wish they put this tools in the hands of some consumers and used their feedback to make some tweaks.

The Good:
*It's quiet.
*On slow mode the battery will last a good amount of time.  Fast mode destroys weeds, but you pay in run time.  (Still worth it.)
*I love the 9ah battery and the rapid charger.  It also charges m12 batteries.
*The construction is reasonably good except for the string head.
*The hedge trimmer just works very well.

The Bad / Ugly:
*You are not able to adjust the angle of the trimming head.  This would be very nice.
*The trimmer feed head is made of some pretty cheap plastic and I have worn two small holes in it after two days of use.
*The trimmer head gets weeds wrapped around the top and it will stop the trimmer at some point.
*The .080 line that comes with the model is too small.  I replaced it with .095 line.  It worked a lot better with this line.  They also overfilled the cartridge with string and it got jammed pretty quickly.  They did not follow their own instructions since it had at least twice the amount of line installed than the manual states.
Instructions for string:
From the manual....Measure out 20' of .095 line or 25' of .080 line.
CAUTION: When replacing the line, use only
MILWAUKEE .080"" or .095"" (2 mm or 2.4 mm)
diameter line. Any other line can degrade performance
or cause damage to the trimmer.
*The twisted string that comes with the trimmer tends to get caught on it self in the feeder.
*It does not come with a strap to help carry this.
*Both tools do not have a good pintle to hang tools in the garage.

The Ridiculous:
*They included a torx hex wrench that works only on 1/2 of the screws you need to set it up.  (The string cutter requires a different size bit.
*The Guard is so small that your legs are covered with grass, poison ivy, etc by the time you are done.

If they would add a carry strap, upgrade the head, widen the guard, drop the .080 string, and allow you to adjust the angle of the head, I would give it five stars.  The string trimmer gets three stars, and the hedge trimmer gets five stars

I don't see any commercial user using the string trimmer, it would not keep up.  Can you imagine having two or three 9 mha batteries for every worker on the crew?  The 12 mha batteries might be enough.  I'd rather buy a few more gas trimmers and a bigger crew.  The hedge trimmer on the other hand is of the quality I expect from Milwaukee and it would meet a commercial need well.

6/26/2018,2861-21CT,"M18 FUEL™ 1/2"" Mid-Torque Impact Wrench with Friction Ring Kit W/ 2.0Ah Battery","I purchased the Milwaukee 2861-21CT Mid-Torque Impact Wrench with Friction Ring from my local Milwaukee dealer. What an amazing tool. Once again, Milwaukee has hit the ball out of the park with this Impact Wrench. I have a Tacoma 4WD pick-up truck, and using the MIDDLE setting on the Impact wrench, this thing popped the lug nuts off like they weren't even fastened down. I was shocked and amazed. I didn't have to use the top and most powerful setting to break these lug nuts loose. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This impact wrench has a LOT of power. I would match this tool up with my air impact wrenches any day of the week. However, you have to keep your expectations REAL. If your working on heavy duty trucks, buses, farm equipment, industrial motors and related equipment types, this might not be the tool for you. You might need the FULL size Milwaukee Impact Wrench for those situations. 
Over the last couple of years, I've slowly changed out all of my power tools from various other brands to EXCLUSIVELY Milwaukee. I've totally embraced the M18/M12 Fuel system. I still have some off brand power tools, which I keep as loaners for people that want to borrow something. I NEVER lend my Milwaukee Tools. What I've learned is this. If you buy junk, no matter how you polish it, at it's core, it's still junk. I'm NOT a Milwaukee employee, and I'm NOT being remunerated in any way by Milwaukee for this review. I love the brand and I love the products that I've purchased. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this tool.",5

Apparently someone at Milwaukee thought it was a good idea to have an orbital blade action. It makes it next to impossible to start a cut without the blade hopping all over the place AND the vibration is unbearable. Don't even get me started on trying to cut metal, pipe or otherwise.
My suggestion to Milwaukee is if you can't improve on the saw scrap the whole thing.
I would give it 0 stars if possible.
BTW this Sawzall might be the 5th one I've purchased over the years and never had a complaint until now. I have other Milwaukee tools as well. Right angle drill, hole hawg and a 1/2 inch drill that was stolen with the Sawzall I replaaced that I can't complain about.",1

6/27/2018,0880-20,M18™ Wet/Dry Vacuum (Bare Tool),"The MILWAUKEE 0880-20 exceeds my expectations for a portable wet/dry vacuum.  It has strong suction and a wonderful hose that stretches and then retains its small size after use.  The switch from dry to wet operation is straightforward.  I personally like the lid that covers the hose, attachments, and battery.  Yes, it is slightly more time-consuming to open the lid in order to remove the battery, but I like the protection that the lid provides. I also like that the vacuum looks like a tool box. The vacuum is a little louder than I anticipated, but the strong suction is worth it.  Battery performance has been superb with the unit.  It is several 15 minutes uses just to have the fuel gauge decrease by one bar. I have not yet used the blower function since that was not my reason for buying the vacuum. I only have one con with the vacuum and it is not work subtracting any points.  When the lower compartment is removed for emptying, some of the dirt from the filter always falls to the floor or desk.  It is not a big deal because I just vacuum those pieces when the compartment has been reattached.  In summary, this is an awesome portable wet/dry vacuum and I highly recommend it.",5
6/28/2018,2362-20,M12™ Lantern/Flood Light,"This is a high quality and innovative lantern.  The build quality is outstanding and the light focusing from 180 to 360 degree is genius.  The USB port is a very nice touch and requiring the USB switch to be depressed before providing power is a good idea to save the M12 battery life.  I really like how the hooks on top fold out of the way when not needed.  I knew in advance that the light output was 400 lumens, but in real life I wish that the light were a little brighter.  That is not a con because I knew the output before purchasing the lantern.  One borderline con is that the light seems to slightly strobe when it is on high output.  That said, the true color claim is true as the surroundings look perfectly lit by the lantern. A nicety is that the medium output setting is only slightly less light that the high output setting. This gives you longer runtime without sacrificing too much light.  I'm very pleased with the light and will use it often.",5

6/28/2018,2460-20,M12™ Cordless Rotary Tool (Tool Only),"I've used a competitor's rotary tool for many years.  There were plenty of available attachments and the unit met my needs.  I saw the 2460-20 in a big box store and was very intrigued by it being cordless.   Since I already have the M12 battery and charger, I decided to try the 2460.  There are several online reviews that comment on vibrations caused by the collet so I immediately replaced it with a keyless chuck.  There were also a few online comments about the device overheating.  Within minutes of opening the box, I cut four 1/4-inch stainless steel bolts. There was no vibration and no overheating.  The 2460 just cut through each bolt.  The 2460 has a slightly higher RPM that my corded rotary tool, but the 2460 seems to be much more powerful. I've used the 2460 to polish an aluminum pump and it performed very well.  It is easy to hold and well-balanced; the rotation is extremely smooth, which prevents hand fatigue.  There are online reviews that question the 2460's durability.  I am hopeful that Milwaukee has resolved those issues, time will tell.  As of today, I can wholly recommend the M12 Cordless Rotary Tool",5

6/29/2018,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"So I got into the M18 system with drill and driver (ah, the simple things)... They were recommended as the most durable of the lithium ion battery tools.  I needed a new trimmer for the yard... I have an acre... but I spend so much time getting extension cord, plugging in, and winding and putting it away (takes more time than the actual trimming).  Went looking to see if the M18 system had a trimmer... sure enough they do, and it was in-stock at the local home improvement store.

I purchased it and wow!!! This is very much as powerful as any plug-in... and in just a few minutes I can do all of the yard (not just what I could reach with a cord)!  Weeks later when it ran out of line... I took the head apart to rewind (who reads directions), and realized that you just feed the new line in with the head in-place, and wind it up (no need to take anything apart!! NEXT TIME read the directions) Couldn't have been easier, well if I had read the directions...

I have two of the big battery packs, but got the entire job done, front and back yards, and did not discharge the first battery.

I highly recommend, and would definitely buy again if I did not already have it. Sometimes a make really good choices... this is one of those times.",5

7/3/2018,49-54-0101,Door/Jamb Butt Template Kit,"Actually have the earlier Bosch 83038/83037 hinge template product. The two are identical, but the Bosch part is no longer available.  Have owned mine for 10+ years and used it on every door I have hung. The Milwaukee instructions  are however much better then those with the original Bosch tool.  The may help  others with the mysteries of set-up.  Once understood, it is easy to use and tweak as needed.  I really like this tool, and hope Milwaukee will continue to produce it, and the spares for years to come.  

Like any tool it is very important to read the instructions. Which is why it is great that Milwaukee have these posted on-line and have clearly taken the time to update them over the original.  This is a relatively expensive tool for what it does, however, random rebates for hinges that don't line up is not  an inexpensive outcome either. 

When using this tool, note you need to be familiar with using  router template guides 
 and how to install these with your router. Definitely recommend practicing  this part of the project on some scrap wood first. This is also where you may accidentally clip the router template guide rails! Which is why spare parts are a necessity.  Although a quick finesse  with a small metal file can usually fix the issue. Again, practice and gain familiarity first will help avoid this misfortune.

Also, the template nails to the door post and door (separately) when used. The nails are a disposable item so be ware that this is an accessory you'll want to buy soon after purchase.  Experience has shown that these actually wear well, but wil eventually need to replace.

The hinge cuts will be rounded, so if using square hinges, make sure to buy one of those corner chisels. They come in real handy and are a nice compliment to this tool in terms of time saving, and finish.

All-in all a great tool that will give years of satisfaction and good service.",5

I like the shadow cut line and the blade that came stock is actually really good. I’m probably going to pick up a framing blade so I don’t abuse the nice one that comes stock. My only gripe is dust collection, it is okay with a hose but...I wish the pick up was on the blade housing. If it was I think this would really make a difference.

7/11/2018,2475-20,M12™ Compact Inflator,"This compact inflator is a well-executed product that does what its designed to. It works best for topping off pressures, and balancing tire pressures over time and seasons. 

Honestly, I did not have my hopes all that high since I've used plenty of portable compressors that suck rather than blow. But this Milwaukee is a winner. 

Regarding the three star review because there is no other way to power it, well that is not the fault of this tool. I do have a powerful car-battery connecting inflator for off-road use. Totally different animal. Plus the runtime of the Milwaukee is 10 minutes on, 10 minutes off. At its inflation rate, it would take a long time to inflate a car tire from zero to 40 psi and way longer than that for a truck tire.  So hooking it up to another power source is overkill for this little guy.

I've gotten good run time from the 2.0 battery (that it came with) but usually have a 4.0 or 6.0 inserted. 

Where this unit really shines is in the speed and simplicity of use. You will keep your tires in perfect pressure year round. And if a pressure indicator light pops on, you can be on it immediately.

To use this you just turn it on, connect the hose, read the pressure, and then toggle to your desired pressure over the current pressure. Hit the on button and it buzzes until the desired pressure is reached. To lower pressure, just let air out of the tire till below the pressure you want, and do the above.

I've run this unit up to about 70 psi. It gets toasty, but no complaints. And for reference, on a normal car tire, I was going about a pound of pressure every 20-40 seconds.",5

7/12/2018,2736-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 8-1/4"" Table Saw w/ One-Key™ Kit","I actually was a product tester for the original DeWalt jobsite saw.  The newer small version was my jobsite saw, but I replaced it with the Milwaukee as soon as it came out as part of my ""brand conversion"" as Milwaukee adds woodworking tools to the lineup.

The design is actually very similar, except it being an 8 1/4"" VS 10"" which really would rarely be an issue.  The Milwaukee saw has better tool strorage and the riving knife is easily removed/installed w/o tools.  It also has a larger rip capacity of 24 1/2"" VS 18"".  Another feature (I'll have to add a photo later if I can) is you can store the fence under the saw while transporting (it's how it comes packed new so pay attention).  I jokingly call this ""turtle mode"".  Any smaller portable saws fence is vulnerable while in your truck or trailer if something should shift and fall, with the fence under the saw this is avoided.

One big advantage of the battery saw is in new home construction the electricians must by code install ""arch arrester"" circuit breakers.  These are easily tripped by large brush AC motors like those on table saws, air compressors and miter boxes.  That is not only frustrating but is lost productivity.   In a recent house we reset breakers about 40 times a day for the corded tools.  I was the only one uneffected because I had the Milwaukee 10"" miter saw.

Another obviouse advantage, no cords.  No cords and no hoses is a big safety advantage.  Ever been on a jobsite when OSHA comes calling?  The first thing they usually do in residential is look for missing ground prongs on cords, cut them off and issue fines.  They also will get you for cords in doorways.  That's why I'm moving toward a cordfree jobsite as much as I can with my Milwaukee table saw and miter saw.  Also for punchout work it's much easier when you can just pull it out of your trailer set it up and cut.  No looking for power.

Thank you Milwaukee I've been waiting for this!",5

I have a half a dozen of these and used to have about half a dozen of the 28 volt. I have had to replace a few over the years but not any more than my Makita batteries.  3 AH is good enough for what I do with the tools. Drills last about a week of average use, Sawzall lasts maybe 15 minutes of continuous cutting but most of my cuts are done in 15 seconds or less. They seem to last about 3-4 years of abuse and dragging them under houses. They seem a little less susceptible to getting wet than my Makitas. I wish they still made the V28.

It moves air great but I think it needs to have one or two hooks built into it like the ridgid fan which I also own and use more often due to being able to hang it from a ladder with ease or off a 2x4 next to me in an attic.

7/14/2018,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I waited to review this tool until I have put a few months in to make a reasonable evaluation.  I use this trimmer primarily around my home and those of my father and my son for the purposes of keeping down the usual spring and summer annual weed crops.  I could cut a half star or so if I wanted a tool that would cut on a vertical, like edging along sidewalks.  But that would imply that such vertical cuts are somehow necessary, which they are not.  I do, in fact, cut along sidewalks but instead of attempting to cut a groove perpendicular to and alongside the sidewalk, I just let it cut flush with the surface of the sidewalk and an inch or so beyond the edge of the sidewalk to get the desired manicured effect.  

As with almost any tool, one has to learn its strengths and weaknesses.  I have noticed that this tool works almost as effectively at half throttle as at full throttle which gives me more work time on a charged than my arm can handle, so it's rare for the battery to go below half charge before I need a rest.  I always attempt to leave at least half battery charge on these tools to prolong the life of battery instead of draining them down to zero each time.  This is a great tool.",5

My single intended use was for charging PET bottles in a bottle rocket launcher with school students in STEM activities. 
The launcher is designed to run off an air compressor which having a large tank provides both pressure and volume so I was worried that this would not work, having no real volume. It kinda worked at first. So after redesigning and re engineering the launch mechanism so it was able to hold a volume of air it now works absolutely perfectly every time. My concern about duty cycle isn’t even an issue in this application. It only takes about 30seconds to run up to pressure and works every time.

The Milwaukees are the new units.We haven't had any failures yet on the other brands (over 5 years of ownership). At close to a year of use, we had 1 Milwaukee fail this month with the bearing falling off. Luckily it is easy to get these tools repaired at a close warranty center but it takes a while for the repaired unit to come back.

7/27/2018,2732-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 7-1/4"" Circular Saw Kit","Great product. Works with all M18 batteries. Kit comes with bag, saw, rapid charger, allen wrench(on board storage into the saw), a 24Tooth framing blade, and a 12.0ah Battery.  I recommend using a5ah battery instead of the 12 due to the weight. The weight was not an issue when I was making straight cuts, but while making beveled cuts with the 12.0 the saw becomes very unbalanced. As there is a lot of weight on the right side of the saw.

Weight:
The weight without the battery was about 8.6 lbs, 
 10.2 lbs with my 5ah 
11.8 with my 12ah battery

Not just for 12.0 ah batteries:
I was able to use my 5.0ah battery as well as my 12.0ah battery with no problems. I have a 3 and 9 I have not used them yet but I will try

What attracted me to the saw and performance:
.I used this saw on some 2x on a jobsite and it ripped right through it. In comparison I was using the 2630 and 2730 and really SAW the difference in speed. The depth guide is behind the blade near the handle, there are markings that are kind of hard to see as the etchings are the same color as the guard and not colored The main reason I decided to get another framing saw was not due to the speed or power. As I am getting older I want to take better care of myself, so safety plays a big part. Breathing in all of the saw dust and especially the dust from MDF is not good for you. I got this solely for the dust port. I ended up buying a tracksaw from a brand that I was not invested in months ago, only because the tracksaws were the only saws on the market with a dust port. This saw is a blade right saw. I am a righty and prefer the blade left styles, but I am kind of glad this a blade right. I connected my vacuum to it I did not have to worry about the hose getting in the way. I cannot wait to try this with the new bac- pac- vac, especially since supposedly it runs quieter. The dust port worked wonderfully as it collected about 90% of the dust from the saw. So I am happy, in addition to safety reasons, having the dust port on the saw attached to vacuum will reduce the cleanup time afterwards.  Love the addition of the dustport

Installing the dust port is simple. Just unscrew the dust shoot on the saw, insert the tab on the far right into it's slot and then screw the port to the saw. 

Charger:
The rapid charger was able to charge the 12ah battery in about 100 minutes. In comparison , the regular m12/m18 charger took about 210minutes to charge the battery.

The medium setting is most helpful driving #8 - #10 self trappers- common every day things. The high speed setting has power that is normally reserved for 18v tools. It does not back down from a challenge.
It's almost an inch shorter than the previous one, which I still use. This extra inch is going to come in handy. Beautiful execution of a plan, Milwaukee! This is why you're the best.",5

7/31/2018,2646-20,M18™ Cordless 2-Speed Grease Gun (Tool Only),"Im a daily greaser of large agricultural tractors and construction equipment. I have many M18 and M12 tools. I’m a huge fan of the two lines, so I figured I’d go with the M18 grease gun. The first gun I received, the second gear was grinding right out of the box. First gear worked no problem.  Not a big deal… Manufacturing defects happen so I understand. My problem is the design, not the quality.  First issue is the air bleed button. It’s a great addition for a grease gun, but I found that it is very sensitive to minor bumps and releases grease on things when it is inadvertently tapped. This happened 3 times. I ended up with grease on my nice tool tote.  Consider a 90 degree cam to where it’ll bleed when you unlock it. When done bleeding just return it to the locked position. second problem is the semi enclosed casing that goes around the grease tube holder. The inside of the casing is not smooth and will prove impossible to get a good cleaning. Third issue, and not a big deal, please include the carry strap with the tool only. I understand that it only comes with the kit. I tried to find the strap on the website but looks like it isn’t sold individually. I took a Kobalt strap from an old tool bag and hooked it up to the gun, worked perfectly but I’d rather stick to red on red, not blue on red, especially since the color and brand are identifiers for my tools versus every one else around me who all seem to be dewalt. Like I said, not a huge deal. I read that the clips on the Milwaukee strap are junk. At least my kobalt strap has some nice solid clips.",2

8/1/2018,48-08-0551,Folding Miter Saw Stand,"Its a nice piece of equipment. well built, sturdy, it will get the job done and look pretty while you do it. All moving parts have a nice smooth action. legs snap closed firm and open easy. When the saw is on it, it is secure and there is no worry it may come loose. 
However, I give 3 stars. There is nothing that stands out as unique. 
I would like to see a more modular approach to accessories like this.It boasts a 500 lb capacity, but as a mitre stand you wouldnt even need half that. utilize the rail with something other than a table. how about, a swivel clamp sturdy enough to secure some material for a cope. the top of the clamp could double as a material support for medium sized pieces. there are never enough clamps. even un umbrella that clicks to rail with an articulating arm, for protection from sun and surprise rain showers. i would also like my stand to have power, Im sure u could add a m18 battery receiver by that handle. Maybe juice up a few usb ports. A holder/bracket to hold m18 vacuum for dust collection. And many other uses for an adaptable rail.
 It definitely needs a wheel as well. Its a battery powered saw, I dont need to stay set up in the same spot, and moving the saw and stand as one itsnt easy. Which takes away from the advantage of having a saw such as this.

I unpacked the battery and placed it in the charger. I came back an hour later expecting to find a fully charged battery but instead the charger was blinking green-red-green-red indicating a faulty battery. A call to Milwaukee confirmed this. My next call was to my supplier to get a replacement battery. I was told that they had no replacement batteries and that my name would be placed on a list (possibly a long one) for a replacement. 
I have a shop full of DeWalt 18volt tools and this was my first foray into the Milwaukee 18fuel line. How does a company like Milwaukee lack the simple quality control that would have prevented a faulty battery pack from ever leaving the factory?

8/5/2018,0880-20,M18™ Wet/Dry Vacuum (Bare Tool),"Works great. Loud as others have mentioned and not as powerful as a big 30 gallon shop vac. Won't quite pick up big nails and bolts that you can get by hand but does just about everything else. BUT its very light and runs for long enough to get the job done on about hakf of a 5.0 battery charge. We use it on nearly every electrical install job. Gets rid of steel shavings, concrete dust, wood dust, dust bunnies, all the stuff that accumulates in and around equipment during installs. I've even taken it to a coal loading terminal and cleaned panels all day where this little thing got all the loose stuff out while I came behind to do a final wipe with denatured alcohol.

I've probably ""sold"" a few. Customers always think it's a tool box then get blown away when we use it. Next time we go back their maintenance crews have them.

Only trouble is no ""IP"" rating for a reason. On the first one I left it in back on a late install in Myrtle Beach. On the way back to North Carolina like usual it rained. Battery was fine even with water puddled in the bottom of the battery compartment but vacuum was destroyed. On a wet/dry vac. I don't think it's safe to use as a wet vac for that reason.

8/8/2018,2740-20,M18 FUEL™ 18ga Brad Nailer (Tool Only),"Dear Sirs,
We are a custom cabinet shop that love to use your high-quality, endurable tools. Recently we purchased a drill and impact set, jig saw, packout set, and nail gun to upgrade our tools. FOR YOUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT... We have been using a Paslode 18 gauge nail gun for the past years which takes a battery and gas cartridge. We were exited that Milwaukee came out with it's battery nail gun 2740-20 and therefore purchased it. After using it to install the crown molding on a job we realized that the gun is inferior to the Paslode. #1 reason-the foot is behind the nose making it impossible to sink the nail unless you are on a perfect 90degree angle.(Paslode has their foot in a circle surrounding the nose). #2 reason-the foot leaves a dent in the wood partially because it bounces hard and the foot is to hard. I really hope Milwaukee can improve these features. Unfortunately for Milwaukee, we had to go back to using our Paslode which means we now have a brand new tool on our hands that is useless. I really hope no other quality cabinet maker makes the same mistake as us. !!!!!!WONDERING IF THERE IS ANY WAY YOU CAN HELP US OUT MILWAUKEE!!!!!! We really enjoy working with your tools! (except the nail gun)! 
Respectfully Yours,

8/9/2018,2550-20,M12™ Rivet Tool (Tool Only),"Seems like the Jaws are not correctly designed.  Ordered 2 of these tools and both of them failed withing 4-5 Hrs of use.

The second tool failed after assembling approx 100 cherry rivets size 1/8""  this time the jaws became very dirty and they were not grabbing and pulling the rivets anymore. The jaws seem to work better for aluminum rivets, but I have to further test to confirm.  The concept is really nice but the jaws must be redesigned in order for me to buy again. Pneumatic tools typical come with 2 half moon jaws instead of 3. Perhaps copying that design could improve the product.

8/15/2018,2131-20,M18 18-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless 2000-Lumen ROCKET LED Stand Work Light W/ M18 Starter Kit (1) 5.0Ah Battery & Charger,"Great product. Excellent source of lighting. This is an upgrade to the original Tower Light, the 2130. This is a hybrid light like the 2135-20 light but unlike that light , this one does not charge the battery while it is plugged in. This light is brighter than the original 2130-20, and that was one was very bright. This light worked well, well working in the basement of a new house that I was helping out with. There was power in the house but there were no lights in the basement instead of setting up the string lights overhead like usual, we set this up and that was all we needed.
This is not meant to be their flagship light, so keeping that in mind I was able to accept it for what it is. With the 12.0 ah battery, I got a runtime of about 9hrs and 48 minutes on high.
The first warning sign that the battery is just about dead, came with 25 minutes left of usage. This light blinked 3x, every minute for 25minutes, after the 25th minute it shut off. Even though I had this running the whole time, the head was a little warm, but not scorching hot. I was able to touch it without burning my hand feeling extreme heat which was good. This is great for outdoor events when the sun goes down


Compared to the original 2130-20, the head has more translucent plate in the top, the words Rocket Light appear on one of the extension poles, this light is brighter, and this one is compatible with a 12ah battery whereas the other one is not. Milwaukee does offer a free(or least I believe it is, I am completing my service request next week) where they will retrofit some products that will not fit the 12.0ah battery


Improvements I would like to see, if they were to upgrade it.


The ability to charge while in use would be good, but I would also like an onboard indicator letting you know if it is on low,med, or high. As well as a battery gauge so you do not have to bend down to check on the battery. Also since Milwaukee has the one key, I would like to have a dedicated spot to hide the tick. Also one key functionality, for some products one key is not that effective for me , but for the lights that program truly shines. I have another light that has it and being able to turn on a light with your phone is truly hopeful.

All in all this is a great product, that proves to be useful during the day and nghtHow you use this product. Things that are great about it. Things that aren't great about it.",5

I find the 12.0ah batteries better suited for stationary items, like the miter saws, table saws, and lighting products. Products that you won't notice the weight since you will not have it in your hand for an extended period of time. 


The 12ah battery was excellent with my dual power light, the 2131-20. On high I got a runtime of almost 10hrs. More than enough for a full day's job on a jobsite with no power and you have to work in dark areas.


There are some products, like the two original rocket lights that won't fit the 12ah batteries, I believe Milwaukee will service those for free, I sent it in via the EService and I am awaiting the modification

The rapid charger was able to charge the 12ah battery in about 100 minutes. In comparison , the regular m12/m18 charger took about 210minutes to charge the battery.

I would expect more from Milwaukee considering the amount of money I've spent in the amount of tools that I own for Milwaukee because they do last with figured they understood that they're going to be in a hard-working person's vehicle and having a nailer with all those tiny pieces and what not have them not get banged up in the truck.

8/25/2018,2890-20,M18™ Jobsite Radio,"Failed after a year and five months of never seeing a job site... just sitting on a shelf. So, the unit has never had good reception but I just chalked it up to being in the garage. I would find somewhat good channels and it was good enough. After time passed it started getting worse, then finally last week it was so distorted it was unusable. Since I was out of warranty and it cost $90 to send it to the repair (per Milwaukee's pdf price guide) facility I decided to tear into it... because it’s obviously not worth the money to repair when a new one is $119. What I found is the printed circuit board has an issue on the right channel bringing both channels down. When both speakers are hooked up to the left channel, everything works fine. Just the right channel is hosed. Also, after much thought radio is kind of lame, no Bluetooth… I mean we are in 2018 are we not? Search UGETube for Milwaukee job site radio review.",1

8/27/2018,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"I run a small lawncare business and was hesitant to take the plunge on battery powered tools on anything bigger than a leaf blower.  Since I had batteries for it already from leaf blower and drill, I thought this hedge trimmer would be a good item to get my feet wet with.  

After 2 weeks I have completely changed my mind about battery operated stuff.  Dollar for Dollar, this is the best investment on my truck to date. Pull it out, stick a battery in, and you are making money.  No hard starts, no warm up, no smoke, just finished work and move on to the next one. The hedges in my own backyard had gotten somewhat out of control (cobbler's children often go barefoot), and this took what was previously a 45 minute job into 15.

Battery life is fantastic.  I have yet to run a battery dead (either 6.0 or 9.0), although I haven't spent a day doing only hedges with it.  I'm not sure what its rated for, but one thing I will mention is that you don't have it running 100% of the time like a gas hedge trimmer.  You pull the trigger and its going, you let up and it stops.  So even it its only going to run ""for an hour"", that whole hour is you cutting and not idle time.

It is also no slouch when it comes to actually performing.  Blades are sharp out of the box and seem to be holding up.  My one complaint here is that the bar is double sided, in my experience quality hedge trimmers use a single sided bar of a higher quality steel.  This has not been an issue however, and I am quickly getting used to being able to cut both ways.",5

From there, I went to my car tires, and deflated them by 3 psi. It took less than 15 seconds a tire to bring them back to 34 PSI. Having this Milwaukee inflator sure beats using my 10 gallon compressor for a quick tire check and fill. Also, I compared the results with two tire gauges that I would normally use. I don't think I'll need the gauges anymore. This is another great product from Milwaukee.",5

When I snow plow my auto shop parking lot I use an open tractor and after an hour or so with a normal winter coat you have a good chill going. With the Milwaukee jacket the chill was not there, I was perfectly comfortable.  Now do not expect to feel the jacket actually heat up, that is not how it is.  It is enough so that you can wear a comfortable work jacket instead of some big bulky coat  to stay warm.  It is tough, flexible for movement and keeps the chill away.  I also like the 3 temperature setting because if I am walking the dogs low is good, while sitting on the tractor with no aerobic movement high is great.",5

This connects like a battery, to disengage after locking it in pull the black circular tab and slide the case forward. I use this for my m12 ratchets and my stapler

The little product overview card that comes with it is not that great, it shows the features and has a line that kind of points to an area but it is so vague that you are not sure what they are pointing to.

When it works, it works great and has plenty of power......WHEN IT WORKS.  Just recently, it started to do 3 things completely at random on me....
1. The light would stay on continuously with that high pitch whistle even when the tool had not been used.
2. Sometimes it would not work at all when pressing the button. 
3. Sometimes the forward or reverse selector button would stay stuck in whatever position it was in last. 
This has caused me to frequently have to remove and reinstall the battery several times in just a few minutes for it to work properly.
This is extremely frustrating and has lead me back to using my Dewalt for everything now.  I hope I am not the only person this has happened to. I will be sending my tool in for repair.",2

But within the first use I was impressed but not completely sure. But within two or three days if using this saw I am completely in love. I have the 9ah battery as well as a 5 and both from the saw as long as you need to in a day. You can go all day long with this song on One battery.

9/7/2018,48-22-5525,Magnetic Tape Measures,"Let me start off by saying I've owned at least 10 of these tapes. The belt clip is what made me buy my first one and it's great for not destroying pockets compared to other brands. Another thing I loved about them was the really big hook (pictured) but unfortunately I can't find this version anymore and fear it may have been discontinued. I have since stopped using these tapes though, they're just not strong enough for professional work. Every single one I have owned has had the end snap off around the 2 or 3-foot mark, the tape quickly gets sucked back in and it's toast. Normally I'm Team Red but I really can't recommend these to anyone who actually needs to use in a professional setting. I have switched brands which now means torn pockets; but at least I don't break a tape every month and can do my job properly again without keeping spare tapes all over the place.",3

It's loud enough that I can keep it on the ground to charge batteries and can still hear it while working in the air but the bluetooth won't connect that far. It usually cuts out about 20' away. The other thing is that it's a pretty big/heavy radio, I used to have a smaller DeWalt radio which was great for scissor lifts, this one is just simply too big to bring up with the rest of the tools & material. If this was made smaller, or if the 2891 had an AM/FM tuner, or if the 2890 had built in bluetooth, I'd be a lot happier.",4

It is almost as if you can read them from across the room!   The level has a very nice heft to it, it is not a discount type piece of equipment. It has a nice wide base that gives it stability and a great appearance.  The two earth magnets are strong! When you hold it near steel or aluminum, the level will snap to the material and hold the level firm.  The magnetic strength of the level is impressive.  One end of the level is perfect for holding it with a single hand.  However, my favorite part is the adjustable vial.  I have an angle measurement device that I would use, but with the torpedo level, I do not need that device.  The angles are easy to ready and the thumbset is easy to lock in the measured angle.

Really like this driver for its power but noticed almost ameaditly that when used left handed in reverse that the trigger sticks this is very annoying so much so I sent it in for service. I was sent a brand new tool unopened or checked that had the same exact issue. I now assume this is a design flaw that should be corrected. Just so you know I'm right handed that's how annoying this flaw is. When your removing kitchen cabinets holding them with your right hand unscrewing with your left hand this is beyond frustrating.,1

Compared to the prior drivers, this has slightly more overall power, but takes just a little longer to drive the 6"" lags that were being used - but without as much hand jolting and without any significant noise - what a difference.  The two biggest attributes that it has that I've not encountered with any other impact driver is the quietness of drive and how it doesn't jerk around in your hand driving the bigger lags.  This drove everything from 1/2"" machine screws in steel & wood to 3"" deck screws to 6"" x 1/2"" lag bolts without any issues.  And with a 5 Ah battery, it never ran out of charge before I did.   
Now being spoiled with the Surge driver, I'm not sure what to do with the older impact drivers - hard to pawn them off on someone else when you know they just are loud noise makers that can't keep a charge long enough in their NiMH batteries to complete the job.  Loved the surge so much, I bought a 2nd so my helper can keep up with me and I don't have to hear him fastening materials with a loud driver.  Keep on driving!",5

9/10/2018,2810-22,M18 FUEL™ Mud Mixer with 180° Handle Kit,"I have been using this mixer for various thinnest mortars and grouts, with the occasional bucket of drywall compound for almost nine months. As far as performance goes this thing gets the job done without missing a beat. I have spun full 50 lb. bags of mortar without any bog down or drag. As for the battery life I usually get two or three days of operation out of each battery charge, which means having two batteries equals never being without power. My only minor issue is that the chuck key, which is housed in the handle, doesn't stay secured any longer. I just leave it in the bag with everything else until I need it. Outside of that, everything about this mixer is a true beast. Buying this will not you disappointed.",5

Awesome grease gun !! Only one complaint.  The grease tube that comes with the gun sometimes makes it hard to prime and grease gets by the rubber plunger and squirts out when you pull it back to reload. I solved this problem by putting a tube from a hand operated alimite 500 grease gun. Works like a charm!! No priming issues and no grease gets by the rubber plunger.,5

9/11/2018,48-32-5700,"SHOCKWAVE™ Lineman's 7/16"" to 1/2"" Impact Socket Adapter (Bulk 10)","The impact socket adapter keeps falling out of the impact driver. I believe the length of the shank is simply too short. If the length of the shank was even longer by 1/4"" I think it would fix it. The socket stays attached to the adapter easy enough if the adapter would stay in the impact driver.

Aside from that it seems to being doing good. However, as I am always over the engine I cannot afford to keep having the impact adapter fall out & as a result I had to return it & buy one with a longer shank.

I typically like Milwaukee tools. However, I think the adapter misses the mark in this case. Hopefully, some attention is put into increasing the shank length. Until then I wouldn't recommend buying this item",1

The different sizes are nice for lots of situations, the striking caps are awesome if you have to hammer on them, the grips are comfy in the hand and the bars are very strong. Unfortunately the chrome finish chipped off the edge pretty fast (within the first use on one even) but the bars still work great, its only looks anyways. I kinda wish the edge of the tips were not so steep, its hard to fit in small cracks to pry at times so that could be a problem for some. Still a great set and worth the investment!",4

In a place where the 2703 would just dig in and keep on going, the 2803 just stops, it seems the electronic torque setting is too low.",2
9/13/2018,2725-21HD,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer Kit,"Used on my 1/4 acre suburban residence to edge around fencing, edging, patio and to edge along my driveway and sidewalk.

I selected this device as I had won a Milwaukee 6 tool combo kit in a raffle a year ago and would have additional batteries if needed/ desired.

This unit has plenty of power and I can see where it might be an outstanding tool for cutting down areas of taller grasses, weeds, or clearing a garden.

I had issues with the line feeding.  While remedying the non feeding spool, I realized I would always be fighting to string the line through the two holes on opposite sides of the spool while attempting to reattach the spool to the trimmer. 

I found the unit to heat up while using the unit even in the ""turtle"" or slow rpm mode.

Despite not being designed to be used as an edger, I used it as one.  It accomplished the task as I was determined to do so.  However, I would recommend selecting a trimmer designed to be an edger that rotates the head/shaft for that purpose.

Every other trimmer I've owned has had a short lifespan (<2 yr) whether powered by fuel mixture, electric cord or battery.  Since my initial evaluation of this one is not to my liking, perhaps it will exceed the considerable 5 yr warranty Milwaukee has on this device.  

I do not recommend this tool for someone with an established yard with trimming and edging needs fulfilled from one device.

Perhaps I can write a more thorough review following the 2019 summer season of use.",3

9/18/2018,2736-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 8-1/4"" Table Saw w/ One-Key™ Kit","I have a big project coming up and thought that the addition of the Milwaukee Fuel M18 8¼” table saw would make things go much better.  I will not go over all the specs you can get those elsewhere, what I hope to do is provide you with some of the features and benefits that helped me come to the conclusion to invest my hard earned money into this product over the competitors. I had several considerations and was very tempted to get a larger 10” corded version on a gravity stand but the more I researched the more I realized I didn’t need it.  You see I already have a wonderful 12” sliding compound miter saw so when I need to make cuts on thick (16/4) material I’m covered, what I didn’t have was a quick reliable, repeatable method of ripping sheet material, and this saw seemed ideal to fill this need.  Other considerations that weighed into this decision was that I won’t need additional power from an already loaded circuit, I won’t be limited to where I can setup by the length and location of cords and outlets, and this model will allow me to do all the cutting I need in a day with plenty of battery reserve to spare.  I’m already invested in Milwaukee’s M18 (and M12) battery platforms so this unit just adds to my repertoire of tools and battery versatility.  Additional benefits that convinced me was its portability, and the ability to lock-out the operation via Milwaukee’s “One-Key” functionality.  This project is in a church where there will likely be children around and while I wouldn’t expect them to be in or around our immediate work area, being able to lock it out is going to give me peace of mind for sure.  I unboxed my new table saw put the new M18 HD12.0Ah battery on charge and while it charged I methodically got to work verifying squareness of the blade to fence, blade to table, blade to miter gauge and of course verifying the 45-degree blade angle setting and checking the flatness of the table itself.  I made some very minor adjustments here and there and also calibrated the installed fence scale which was off maybe just a tad more than a thirty-seconds of an inch.  Now I am a big believer in getting my tools square as much as practical since error compounds over length and the number of joints, and despite this being a “jobsite” table saw intended for less than absolute precision I will be making cabinet grade furnishings on this project as well, so taking the time now to get these correct and verifying them is going to give me confidence when the project begins that my saw is ready to deliver.  I also have heard horror stories of new equipment being taken to a worksite, used and not verified beforehand only to create major headaches after the crew figures out the new saw isn’t square and I have also heard of units being bought that ultimately need to be returned because of some manufacturing error that just can’t be adjusted out.  Lastly I can’t imagine a world where any company mass produces these products and they come out to your local big box stores after multiple shipping stops and the consumer would even assume that the unit is completely square, so I verify and while doing this it helps me gain familiarity with my new saw.  I really appreciate the design of this table saw, the blade is set well back to allow for most material to be confidently set onto the table and unlike some jobsite table saws this unit offers miter gauge slots on each side of the blade.  The ability to be able to rip full 4 x 8ft sheets of plywood lengthwise was a must for my project and this saw offers that and a bit more (24½ inches) while others come up just a few inches short (22 inches), again I’m not sure why the competitors stop 2 inches short but some do.  This saw offers the fastest raise/lower ratio of any in its class, I know it doesn’t sound like a big deal but 14 turns to full up versus 36 turns on some of the competitors is a big time saver, especially over the length of a project.  This saw also employs a blade brake if you’re old enough to remember or maybe you own a table saw that doesn’t have this feature you’ll notice it right away.  While it isn’t that long it does seem like an eternity of waiting for the blade to coast to a stop on saws that don’t employ this nice feature.  While the project I’ll be working has a deadline it’s not like I’m in a time critical environment but I just hate wasting time on things that are really unnecessary and these seemingly minor features save me from that and I appreciate that the Milwaukee Engineer’s kept that in mind when planning the gear ratio and including the blade brake on this unit.  Having only made some test cuts and not yet started my project I look forward to getting to know this saw, its capabilities and limitations in a real world work environment, but as of today I have no reason to think it won’t do everything I need it to so I would recommend this to my friends and co-workers if they pressed me for my opinion.How you use this product.

I decided to purchase this awesome Rocket Light to supplement me on those evenings and feel it is vitally important that you have good lighting when working with potentially dangerous saws and equipment.  This light gives off plenty of lumens to brighten up my work area for all the work I need to do. I really appreciate the option of being able to plug this light into a wall socket/extension cord if I don’t want to run it off the battery, it just makes sense.  The ability to setup and take down this unit in a matter of seconds just makes it even better, who has time to monkey around with finicky stands and poor designs when this unit sets up so quick and easy!  If you consider it, there can be a lot of time taken up with what I call superfluous tasks, equipment setup/breakdown, running cords, setting up lighting, waiting on equipment (start-up/coast down) even the time it takes to transit between your gear and the actual work site, that’s why I value every opportunity to eliminate wasted time and effort when there is a better way.  The option to change the brightness level is another very handy feature, this allows me to scale the light to just the right amount.  Some of the lights I’ve tried are very bright and have more of a “spot light” type beam they actually can be frustrating because of the harsh and strong shadows they create, working under that type of light can be difficult seems like I’m constantly repositioning them, but the Rocket dual power tower light by Milwaukee helps me avoid harsh shadows and select just the right amount of illumination to give you the ideal work environment.  Details like this make you realize that the designers have actually been in a similar situation so they get it, and that gives me confidence that they are in it to make sure they get it right.  Another great feature is the ability to raise the light to 7ft.  At this height it will clear most people and give you ideal high perspective lighting best suited for effective illumination while avoiding the regular blackouts associated with people moving between my work area and the light.How you use this product.

The flat ones would not install at all, the way the fitting is made will not accept any flat disks. They must be screw on or depressed center.

I needed the batteries because  my Milwaukee portable stool with built-in vacuum/blower did not come with one.  The 2702 replaces my old DeWalt DC984 14.4V hammer-drill.  
The new drill is much smaller and lighter than my old one but has more power.  The new one has 42 pound-feet of torque but only weighs about 3.9 pounds with a 2.0 Ah battery.  The old drill gives 35 pound-feet of torque but weighs about 5.3 pounds with a 2.4 Ah battery.  The new drill has a more efficent motor and does more work with a 2.0 Ah battery than the old one did with a 2.4 Ah.  The 2702 is a great all purpose drill for home professional or light to moderate duty contractor use.  
Only gave it 4 stars because it would be better if the bit holders, pocket clips, and side handles were stocked by dealers. More led lights on the front and a battery gauge on the tool [like an M12 drill] would be good too.  As it is now I would still recommend it to a friend.How you use this product.

9/28/2018,302B-20M,M12 Heated Hoodie,I got one of the heated hoodie a few years back. It is a great on most spring and fall days. The first problem is that the heating pad on the back is to high. It should be lower to help keep your lower back warm. I know from experience when your working in construction you are always moving and bending and your lower back always gets cold. An I have had that happen even when wearing the heated hoodie. The other item is the inner pocket that holds the battery could be moved forward a little bit because I found it digging it my side when I am driving.

9/28/2018,0885-20,M18 FUEL 18-Volt Lithium-Ion Brushless 1 Gal. Cordless 3-in-1 Backpack Vacuum (Tool-Only),"First let me say that this is NOT A WET/DRY VAC. I want to emphasize that because that was a question I had since I first found out about this, but never saw anyone mention it. I contacted Milwaukee directly, and they responded to my e-mail very quickly .Great service.

Quick Review:
Great Vac This is a DRY VAC ONLY, Very quiet and powerful. Great runtime with the 9 and 12.0 ah batteries
I love the design(You try to battle my boys, that's not legal OWWWWW)
Cons: The placement of the power switch makes it a hassle to power on and off especially if you are hanging it from a ladder. When attached to other tools the vac pulls its (due to suction) while you are pushing the tool. You may have to buy the 9ft hose to fix that


More In Depth Review
This BackPackVac is surprisingly quiet. , all of the noise that you will hear is basically from the attachment nozzles. If you take them off(the crevice tool and wand) It is virtually quiet. I think the pivot point for the hose is a great idea, adds lots of mobility to the tool. I barely had to put this on high. Having it on Low I will able to pick up everything that I need to, dust bunnies, dirt, saw dust. I put it on high on carpeted areas to get the stuff that the carpet was attached to and it worked. On Low I measured about 67db and high was around 74db for me

This lost a star from me due to placement of the power switch. This is advertised as a 3 in 1, so you can wear it, carry it and hang it. To me it is a burden to operate it while it is hanging. I found that since the power switch is located on the bottom of the vac, trying to turn it on and off while hanging it from a ladder can be rather cumbersome. I had to keep going up and down the ladder to hit the switch. 

One suggestion for an updated model would be to have to two places to turn the vac on from, one of which could on top of the Vac. Looking at the new heated gear from Milwaukee, they can take a page from their book and have the emblem on the strap turn it off and on by pressing it. Making it a lot easy to switch modes and not have to worry about your shoulder.

I used this with several tools and it did not perform that well. I attached it to my cordless router, myM18 circular saw and m18 Jigsaw and I still had lots of dust flying around. I think it was mainly due to the placement of the vacuum ports on these products, it is on the back of the tools. I feel they would have more effective on the front, at the point of the cut capturing the dust soon as it forms. The hose has a nice rubbery connector that fits snugly around the ports which is good.

While attached to these tools, the hose contracts when in use, at times making it hard to maneuver the tool, the vac is pulling it while you are pushing it. I see why they have an optional 9ft hose, I will try it with that and that should make it more manageable.

Some other suggestions I have are: Again taking after the M12 products , have an onboard fuel gauge making it easier to see how much juice you have left in your battery. There is a packout dolly, I think it would be good to have an attachment so you can hook this up to a dolly and roll the Vac around like a tradition shopvac so you do not have to carry it. Also add a light somewhere. It's 2018 it seems like everything has an LED light so when you get something without it , you really notice the missing feature. Having a led would be great, especially when I am on my sites for New Construction and cleaning up after all the sheathing is on and there is no natural light coming in . This way I can touch up without breaking out an additional light source.",4
9/28/2018,48-22-8426,PACKOUT™ Rolling Tool Box,"I repair milling machines and generally take 80 pounds of hand tool to the job site. This works really well for that. The only problem I have with it is that even folded down the handle is still taller than the rails of a standard pickup truck, so you can't close the truck up if you have a tonneau cover or fiberglass bed cover. The other option is to lay the tool box on it's back but then the tools get all mixed up as you are driving. Maybe they can come up with a 3 piece handle extension instead of a 2 piece. What they've done is very well made.",4

Quick Review: 
Very handy for small projects due to size and weight(very light)

Cons: Shoe blocks the light, No accessory to protect the blade when it is attached to the saw and you are transporting it, you have to remove the blade every time.


Overall a very good products. Cuts well( I mainly used this for MDF and Polycarbonate for a project I am working on)

I do a lot of work with 1/2"" MDF and this worked perfectly. Having this for small work pieces is nice and handy, especially since you do not have to bring out bigger saws.

Lefty Tighty, Righty Loosey. The first thing that I noticed is that in order to tighten the spindle for the blade, you have to turn it counterclockwise, to the left, and to loosen it turn it clockwise, to the right. I always forget when switching blades. I had some 3rd party blades and they fit this but one of them was a flush cut blade that protrudes further than the rest and the blade rubbed up against the included blade guard so I could not use it. There is a white bar(see the pictures below that indicates whether it is locked, in forward, or reverse mode.

This lost a star for me due to a few design flaws, when you have the shoe and guard attached, the LED light becomes useless as the base of the guard obstructs the LED. Also inserting and removing the shoe can be a bit bothersome as it does not always go on right away. The blade gets in the way a lot When dealing with MDF it is wise to use as much preventative measures for dust extraction as possible. Another gripe I had is that when the blades are attached there is no way to protect them while they are attached to the tool and you have ready to transport it. You basically have to remove the blade each time you want to transport the saw to a different job site. Adding a cover to shield the blades during transport would be very helpful. Another issue, for me, is that the Depth Guide  indicator for the shoe is the same color as the shoe, black. I felt like this should have been a different color. As a quick fix, I painted the arrow so the arrow is easier to spot.

Charge time right out of the bag with the included charger was pretty long 1hr for the 4.0ah. I am getting older and appreciate the smaller things, I am glad that this comes with a small Ziploc bag for the flanges, makes it easier to keep the flanges and other small things nearby and not have to worry about losing them, as oppose to just putting them in a regular small plastic bag.

Since Milwaukee has the packout lines, I would to see more and more tools bundled with the organizers instead of the bags. As they are good for keeping the tools and accessories in one place",4

How you use this product. Things that are great about it. Things that aren't great about it.",4
10/2/2018,2737-20,M18 FUEL D-Handle Jig Saw,"This saw cuts very cleanly. This lost a star from me for a few reasons. The dust extraction, tool free blade removal) and the guard around the blade (I was expecting a hard plastic material but this is a flimsy piece of plastic that I have to be extra careful with to make sure I do not break it). What put this jigsaw on my radar was the included dust port. I am always working with MDF and anything that will help reduce the amount in the air is a good thing. The fact that the dust port is in the back minimizes the amount of dust it collects, it should be near the front towards the cut line, to get it at the source.


This has a tool free blade change but it needs to be reworked. I say that because I had the saw upside down, with the battery out, and when I pushed the lever to remove the blade , the blade flew out of the saw, not very high not even an 1"" or 2"" but nonetheless I was not expecting it to eject like that. I figured the tool release would just release the blade not chuck it.


The LED is very bright and lights up the work surface well, I was in a dimly lit room and I was able to see the cutline perfectly. The non marring base is great also, it is nice and smooth and allowed my saw to slide across the MDF without scratching the surface. At first I thought this saw was pretty heavy, but the only time I noticed the weight was when I first used it. Now I barely notice it, or it is not an issue I should say.

I have tried to test it and several locations. it always tells me the same my van is in my driveway.
 I've even walked past my van with other cell phone and even my own cell phone with the tech app on it. it does not Link in in order to update to tell me where my Vans at. other than that let's be realistic. if someone steals your stuff what is the odds of them having the “TICK” app on their cell phone. or whoever they sell your stuff to having the “TICK” app in order for it to update for you to find your stuff.
I have also program them and set them up and try them on my generator, my air compressor, and my riding lawn mower. None of them have ever been able to tell me anything other than the item is located in my own yard. and I've always tested them with the item away from my home.

10/11/2018,2402-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Hex 2-Speed Screwdriver (Tool Only)","This driver is much lighter weight and is shorter than the version with the 3-jaw chuck and I much prefer this style chuck for most work. I have several drivers with a hex chuck like this one and while this one isn’t my favorite, it is very nice for more heavy duty driving and drilling. The lowest setting on the clutch is still pretty stiff so the clutch isn’t as sensitive for small fasteners as other similar drivers. The high torque and high rpm are where this one shines. It is sort of compact at 6.6” long, especially compared to an 18v unit with a slide style battery but might be the largest 12v hex chuck drill available. It is not necessarily light weight in comparison to other 12v hex drills, either, but is not extremely heavy. It’s 2lb, 6oz with a battery and within 13oz difference compared to my lightest 12v driver. The trigger modulation is pretty good for rpm control and the clutch settings seem provide consistent results whether full speed or low rpm. I do like the way the chuck works and I also like the separate selector ring for drilling and driving. You can switch from a clutch setting to full lock drilling and back with Just small twists of the selector ring without losing your clutch setting. The chuck doesn’t fully lock with 1” insert bits and also doesn’t fully lock back with double ended bits but it will start to move toward locked position and will hold both of these types of bits. It locks in the double ended bits better but only seems to really work correctly with power bits that aren’t double ended or quick change extensions and other bit holders. The hex chuck has really tight tolerances and locks power bits in with minimal wobble or runout. When unlocking the chuck, it will eject an inserted bit with spring force and if you forget to be ready, you’ll be picking up bits from the floor frequently. The collar stays open after removing a bit but will automatically go into locked position upon inserting a bit. The locking collar is really well executed. I chose this model rather than waiting for a gen2 fuel version since I own a ge2 fuel drill with Jacobs style chuck and I don’t trust the electronic clutch at higher rpm with small fasteners as It will overdrive small sensitive fasteners even on the lowest clutch setting. This one will as well because even the lowest setting is pretty stiff for small screws but it is more predictable at any rpm whereas the electronic clutch of the gen2 can kick in late at high rpm. For really sensitive work I use one of my other 12v hex chuck drivers. I hope this is helpful.",4

10/12/2018,2106,Alk Headlamp,"This is an update to my original review. Since my original purchase of this Milwaukee 300 lumen headlamp in June I now just recieved my 6th light. 4 of them exchanged at the Home Depot and the 3rd and now 6th (current one) exchanged by Milwaukee. Again I love this light due to it's small compact size and the light output.  It is very bright and with the True View High Definition light, it is excellent for working on things in the dark. You get the same type of light as if you were working during the day. Shadows are minimal due to the 3 led diodes. The headband is comfortable, the light is IP54 water and dust resistant, which is nice for those times when I get caught in the rain. The only improvement that needs to me made as mentioned in most of the reviews is the pivot bracket needs to be redesigned. Like I said this is now headlamp number 6, and I am not rough with the light. Although the light is advertised as impact resistant, I have never dropped the light. Just normal light use and the bracket breaks. 
If this is the redesigned version (according to another reviewer or product question answer from Feb 2018) I find it hard to believe due to Milwaukees history of excellent products. I have numerous other headlamps with just about all of them being manufactured by different companies that have yet to break. In the time I have to wait for replacement of this light, I resort back to one if them but find I dont like them as much because,  they are not as bright and dont have the True View light output. They are the standard white/blueish tint light.
Both the Home Depot and Milwaukee are great with replacement, but I have never had to get a product replaced more than once, and I have used many many tools,  electronics, and equipment.

I also use a 6ah battery for the bigger tires. Now alot of reviewers have stated how much easier these are than hauling out the compressor and hose but no one has mentioned how long it takes for their compressor to fill to pressure and bending over the whole time putting pressure on the fill chuck then stopping to check psi. then putting more in or letting too much out.this is much simpler ...screw on the valve connector turn on the little guy set pressure start the compressor unscrew the connector when it stops go to the next tire. Time is a luxury in my buisness and this little tool will save a lot for me.

Would not try to fill our class A tire from empty but will try to top one off. This is where Milwaukee could market a larger m18 version for the rv's yes most have compressors in tow but this would be a convienance most would go for especially if they are already on the 18vt. platform just my 2 cents.

10/26/2018,2132-20,M12 12-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless 1400 Lumen ROCKET LED Stand Work Light (Tool-Only),"Quick Review: Bright Light, to me removing the battery is a hassle so much so that it lost 2 stars mainly due to that, very difficult to remove, for me, as I had very little clearance to pinch the tabs on the side. If this had the ability to charge the battery this would have been a 4.

More In Depth Review:

This light lost 2 stars from me because operating it can be a hassle at times. My main issue with it is the battery port, removing the battery is harder than setting up the light itself. I experienced difficulty removing the battery from other M12 products but those experiences were never as frustrating as this one. There is not much clearance to stick my fingers in to remove it, so getting the battery out is always difficult. I always have to shimmy it out and even then if I am lucky I can remove it in about 5 secs, on other occasions I spent about 30seconds fighting with it to release my battery. If this charged the battery while the light was in use, it would be bearable, but the way it is now it is a major flaw to me. Another issue is that collapsing the light, at times can be difficult also. I do not want to push down too hard, for fear of snapping it but I have to exert more pressure than I would like to. Another issue( a small issue) is the battery gauge, It only comes on momentarily. I feel that it should stay on the whole time so you can see how much juice you have without shutting off the light(as it only comes on when the light is turned on)

Performance:
The light is very bright and very lightweight, I had no problems carrying it. I used this for about a week, one occurrence was at night when I had to grab something in the backyard. This lit up the area I needed it to just fine. Carrying it was no problem as it was so light. This light has 2 modes, High and Low

How does this compare to the other Rocket Lights?
Differences the Handle, the way this one is setup, no matter what side you grab it from, when it is fully collapsed, you can use the legs as handles.
-The M12 Light has 2 modes for the lights(High or Low), whereas the M18 lights have 3(High,Med, and Low)
- All of the  M18 Rocket lights, have 2 sets of clamps on the lights, so you can set it anywhere along the way to it's maximum height. This one has 2 stops along the way , and those are the only 2 places to set the height of the light, 3 if you count it's initial position.
- The position of the outlet is one the same side as one of the legs, therefore to plug something in, it is best to do it when the light is fully collapsed, otherwise you can still do it, but you will be fighting with the legs.
-The head for the light rotates to about 225degrees.

Suggested Improvement:
Increase the maximum height,
Add One Key functionality
Let it operate like the M18 RocketLight with 3 heads, so you can charge the battery
Use the same clamp design for the all of the m18 Rocket Lights, so collapsing it is simple, and you can set the height exactly where you want it",3

10/30/2018,2775-211,M18 FUEL™ SWITCH PACK™ Sectional Drum System,"I am a professional drain cleaner.  I added the Switch Pack to my equipment set about two months ago.  My assessment:  This snake is a money maker.  It has earned a permanent place on my already overstuffed truck.  I have 25' of 1/2"" cable (other brand) that I use primarily for kitchen and laundry drains and some light work on main sewers (good for crawl spaces).  I haven't relied on it yet for my heavy duty snaking, but for quick in and out jobs it is very fast and efficient.  The enclosed drum is mess free (good for inside jobs) but drains the water away from the cable to minimize rust.  Battery life is not an issue.  I use the machine daily with the larger batteries and only have to charge them about once a week.  I don't think this machine needs an auto feed.  It feeds very smooth by hand both in and out.  (But I am not an auto feed fan; all my machines are hand feed.)  A few thoughts and recommendations:  1) The machine is mostly plastic (good for weight, bad for durability).  I am the business owner and I take care of my equipment - not sure how it will hold up to daily use by employees.  2) I hope that Milwaukee will consider making a cart for this machine, or offer a cart base as an option.  3) Please offer replacement foot pedals with extra long (8') cord.

With the weight of that saw, make sure you have everything perfectly aligned if you don't want to wrestle with it.

10/31/2018,6955-20,"12"" Dual-Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw","OK .. First off, I must bow my head in shame. 
Even though I have a ridiculous  amount of Milwaukee tools and nothing yellow, after reading all kinds of reviews from ""experts"" I fell for it and bought a DWS780. They were saying things like ""Yellow tools have been in the saw business forever, they know what they're doing"".
Well, after 2 days of having that saw, I happened to be at a friend's place who just bought the Milwaukee. I used his saw and couldn't get over how much smoother it was in every way. The rails glided so much better, were on the bottom instead of the top, the tray rotated better, it had a passive start, constant RPM technology, an electric brake, a gear driven motor so no belts to stretch and break, the fine tuning actually came in really handy and did an awesome job, the digital readout was a welcome added bonus and the whole saw in general just feels better to work with!!! OH!! And the dust collection is night and day! Its SO much better on the Milwaukee!!
For a tool I plan on having for years, the answer was clear and I returned that yellow piece of junk asap and got what I KNEW I should have bought in the first place! The only explanation I can think of  that the yellow tool had more votes in the comparisons is those people are too sold on their yellow collection and have never bothered to even look at the specs of other saws! 
I also got to try out a blue just the other day and while the axial-glide system is maybe even slightly smoother then the Milwaukee, the Milwaukee is still by far better because of all the other reasons listed above and also that blue saw didn't seem to want to give an accurate cut, not sure if it was the blade or the saw causing the flex, but it just assured me that I had made the right choice in exchanging for the Milwaukee.
After just over a month now with my Milwaukee, 1,200 feet of hardwood floor, moldings and currently working on building kitchen cabinets, this saw has worked wonderfully for me and I love it!

11/3/2018,2772A-21,M18 FUEL™ Drain Snake w/ CABLE DRIVE™ Kit,"Milwaukee has hit this out of the park. I’m not usually one who writes reviews, but as a licensed Master Plumber with 15 years of trade experience I have used many different machines. 

First, it’s cordless so no need to make a customer unplug something in the kitchen or carry an extension cord into the job.  Second, the fully enclosed drum ensures the outer shell does not spin. When you’re under a sink typical pistol machines have the outer drum spinning usually in contact with your forearm which eventually hurts your arm on long drain runs. Also the enclosed drum keeps the spinning inner drum from throwing dirty water inside a customers cabinet which speeds clean up. 

Third the feed system is brilliant. You can hold the feed system like a typical trigger for hard clogs that need to be worked slowly or you can lock it to send it down the drain for subsequent passes.  This keeps the strain off your arm having to hold the trigger down. Doesn’t sound like a huge deal but anyone who’s used a pistol machine on a regular basis can tell you your arm gets really tired after 20-30 min of working. 

The case is also well designed storing the machine in the cable down position will allow all the water to drain by gravity during storage instead of sitting in your drum eventually ruining your cable. 

And lastly speed. With the auto lock engaged, this machine is faster than anything on the market. Any good drain cleaner knows the key to full removal is repeated passes while flushing water to fully clear drain debris.  I can do 5 passes with this machine in the time it takes to do one with a K-50 or 3 passes in the time I can do one with a k-35 or supervee. Time is money, and you can do a better job in less time with this machine.  This reduces callbacks and increases productivity.",5

11/5/2018,2625-20,M18™ HACKZALL® Recip Saw (Tool Only),"This is without a doubt the best saw I have ever owned as a plumber.  The benefits it offers over a standard sawzall cant be overstated.  First it is a 1 handed design, which makes all the difference in the world. Sure you can use a standard Sawzall with one hand but at times that can feel awkward, heavy, and control can be an issue. This one hand design is light weight and nicely balanced. And with it being so light and balanced you never have an issue with control.  It's just super comfortable.  The second biggest advantage is it's size.  It is much more compact that your standard Sawzall so it can get in tight spaces much easier. I have to cut a lot of pre-existing copper pipe on remodels for commercial jobs so trying to get a clean cut on 2"" copper with a standard sawzall or a bandsaw when you have hvac duct and electrical conduit all tightly grouped together can cause quite a few raging cuss words to be thrown out, my helper can attest to that.  But with this saw I can get in and out relatively easy and make a perfect cut. And lastly the has plenty of power.  I easily cut through large cpvc, sch 40 and 40 PVC, copper, Unistrut, all thread, wood with no problems.  So if you a plumber you definitely should pick this up. But you want the m18 saw, I've tried the m12 version with the 6.0xc battery and while it cut all those materials you definitely notice the difference, so spend the extra and get the m18",5

11/9/2018,48-22-8426,PACKOUT™ Rolling Tool Box,"I store a lot of tools in the box (I have the rolling box, large tool box, and 3 organizers), which I keep in my work van.  It is sort of an extension of my shelving in the van, except I can haul in tons of plumbing, electric, drywall stuff as needed.  I purchased to minimize the number of trips for pack in/ pack out, and it fit the bill.  Also of course helps a lot with organization.  

I haven't had a toolbox like this before.  The size is great, the associated large tool box that stack on this has a perfect size for carrying around (not to big to clear doors and stuff (16"" wide), big enough to carry good amount of tools 22"" long, good depth).  

I'll take a guess about the wheel complaints.  My setup probably ways 200 pounds or more.  If I rolled it out of the van and let it drop 2 feet, I imagine the wheels would break off.  Just knowing that some people have had issues, I make sure not to abuse them.  So far no problems.",5

11/11/2018,48-22-8426,PACKOUT™ Rolling Tool Box,"Wow, I love this Milwaukee PACKOUT System, it is so well designed and very substatial. One interesting spec that doesn’t get much air time is the units rated weight capacities which are as follows: Milwaukee - 250lbs, HD brand - 100lbs, Yellow - 88lbs, Orange - 60lbs. 
When it comes to long term durability this rating will matter, the more often you pack these systems at or near their rated weight limit the more stress and likelihood they will eventually fail. The Milwaukee PACKOUT components look more rugged and durable just by a visual examination and the published weight rating confirms this. This PACKOUT system has a much higher weight limit a full one and a half times more than the next highest, that’s significantly more. I don’t expect that many are going to stuff 250lbs into one of these, but I also think that one could reach 125lbs without much effort. The question is which one do you think will last longer the one rated at 88lbs that’s now stuffed over capacity or the one rated at 250lbs that’s sitting at half of the rated capacity? My money is on the one that is not over it’s weight limit and I think that is exactly what Milwaukee engineers were thinking when they designed theirs to that high weight rating. Since all the main competitors offer very similar sizing volume wise and the primary purpose is to haul around dead weight the weight capacity would seem to be the number one thing a consumer would compare when all other things are relatively the same. Most similar mobile tool storage systems also offer telescoping handles, wheels, waterproof seals, and a way to attach a lock, the main distinguishing factor is weight capacity and Milwaukee’s PACKOUT system is 2, 3 and even 4 times the capacity of the others, that’s significant.

Toolbox Attachment Method: Another major difference between the PACKOUT system when compared to the competition is the attach/detach method used.  Milwaukee’s PACKOUT uses a very secure one handed slide and lock configuration that is both simple and strong. As I mentioned you only need one hand to attach or remove individual components and because of this its fast and efficient. It’s hard to realize just how intuitive it is until you use it and especially if you have ever tried the others this is a really excellent design feature.

Toolbox Construction Design: Another significant difference is the design of the tool box portion itself, these are not simply a box shape with wheels, they really worked hard to strengthen inherent weak points like the corners. I can’t help but think that Milwaukee’s design which incorporates the aluminum corner grabs was more about constructing a stronger box than about giving the users a grab spot. One of the weakest parts of these types of plastic composite tool boxes are the corners, look at how these are constructed and you can see a lot of effort went into “beefing” up the corners, by rounding them, adding the corner “stiffener” which forms the back of the exterior grab channel in the corners. There’s just a massive amount of material in these corners used in various ways all aiding in, no doubt, strengthening these boxes for the long term use of industry professionals and DIYer’s alike, gotta love it! No I am convinced that the grab handles IMHO were added after they settled on an extremely durable corner design and I think it was brilliant, not only does it offer a grab point for users but it protects from impacts on the more vulnerable corners.

Other Great Features: The telescoping handle is very sturdy and seems very well built and easily able to handle heavy loads, it’s simple to operate and provides a long thick handle for easy gripping and maneuvering, just well done.  
   Another thoughtful feature on the wheeled unit is the upper and lower wire hooks intended to be attachment points for bungee straps so you can secure non-PACKOUT gear or materials right to your PACKOUT wheeled cart for ease of transport, nice touch.
   I have mounted Milwaukee’s “Tick” locating devices onto the under side of the lids in a spot specifically designed for them enabling me to keep track of my PACKOUT mobile tool boxes, how convenient! 

   Frankly the Milwaukee PACKOUT mobile tool storage system is in a class all it’s own, far above the so called competition. I am completely satisfied with my purchase and have already recommended it to friends and relatives. It is more expensive than other brands but you get what you pay for.",5

I've had mine for about three years now and the only issue I've had, is that the cuffs of the hoodie's arms are unusually tight, which can be a hassle if I'm trying to work near water and don't want to get my sleeves wet.

The tailoring is a serious improvement for the female body. I love the fit and feel. It's just November so the jacket has yet to be tested in the deep cold of Wisconsin January. Stay tuned. 
So, why only 3 Stars?? It is lightweight but without the battery. The battery is ridiculously bulky and adds an unbalanced weight. I think that while it works for the men's jacket, it makes little sense in a women's tailored piece. In proportion to my body size, its like having a 12oz can of beer (without the beer!) sticking out of my back. In particular, wearing this as a mid-layer under any other coat was uncomfortable.

11/17/2018,303B-20M,M12 Heated Axis Vest,"Overall it is a great product, fits as expected and battery life is good. The multiple heat sitting is a great addition seeing I am constantly indoors then outdoors, you do not have to remove layers to avoid over heating/ sweating.
Only issues is the battery is round & a bit bulky, when I wear my tool belt the battery is in the way. If the battery was flat & square like a wallet it would sit better on your side and be more comfortable when wearing a tool belt.",4
11/17/2018,0885-20,M18 FUEL 18-Volt Lithium-Ion Brushless 1 Gal. Cordless 3-in-1 Backpack Vacuum (Tool-Only),"I have many Milwaukee Tools all cordless. M18 and M12. 
The vacuum suction is awesome. I use it on carpet wood and Concrete and found that it did a great job on all surfaces. And the use of this vacuum is very friendly, functional and easy. And use it with a 9.0 battery and I don't find it too heavy. The two-speed on-off switch is conveniently placed on the side. One of its best features it is very quiet! 
 The run time is quite good! 

One big con in my line. 
 One of the reasons I bought this was for dust collection. Which it works very well. Like I already said... the suction it great.  But..... con The filter does NOT like fine dust such as drywall or old blown in insulation weather it is hooked up to my M18 sander or vacuuming the floor. It works great for 5-10 minutes max then you have to clean the filter! This is a problem for me. I love the bagless design and the filter design but it clogs extremely fast. Which is a problem. This 

Things to fix....
The filter work great in stopping dust from blowing through but clogs too easy and too much! Need a bag or some type different additional filter that may clean it's self so you can get a longer run time between cleaning it!

Make a power carpet head that runs on a M18 battery as a purchasable accessory. That would just be cool and I would buy it.

Make a pack out caddy with wheels for it.",4

11/18/2018,2404-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/2"" Hammer Drill/Driver (Tool Only)","I am an industrial maintenance Engineer. I build and modify industrial equipment every day and use a 1.5"" step bit everyday in steel up to an 1/8"" thick.  This drill does it with no problem. During a project where we were building a set of offices for our production department me and a coworker were working together to frame, sheetrock, and hang drop cielings. I was using my M12 1/2"" Hammerdrill with the 6.0mah battery and  he was using a Ridgid 18v drill/driver with a 2.0mah both fully charged and less then a year old. After framing the walls with 3"" deck screws his battery was dead. Where as I was able to frame, set concrete anchors, hang sheetrock, hang doors and windows, and hang the drop cieling and use a 5/8"" ship auger bit to drill almost all of the holes before my battery went. My day and a half to his half day. I also do task rabbit so often times I will work an 8-10hr day and then pack up my backpack with my drill and assemble IKEA furniture or hang TVs and pictures or the like for another 2-4 hrs and only need 1 battery for the whole day. I've used a ton of these compact 12v drills trying to find a small drill to fit in my pouch and they are usually only homeowner grade. This drill and the whole M12 line is unparalleled in the entire market.",5
11/19/2018,1107-6,1/2 D-Handle Drill 0-500 RPM,"This model in particular, with the quick lok cord, is the best.  You can add 25' of cord with the twist your wrist and have a long lead great for working in a space without having to drag a knot to an extension cord with out while working on an 8 or 10' tool cord.  This tool, with the correct bit, will cut through anything.  Its also a great dual purpose tool in that it not only drills holes, but it also will mix anything with a paddle.  Its not cheap, but for anybody who wants to be really productive, it is a must have.  You can switch out the chuck to a keyless, or chuck in a quick change for 7/16 and really work quickly cutting holes.  There really is nothing like these drills.",5
11/19/2018,9092-20,7/16 in. Hex Quick-Change Impact Wrench,"A lot has changed since I began in construction and this here is one of the innovations.  When using auger bits to drill holes, or even hole saws, these are invaluable.  You can insert any bit with a 7/16 shank into the end and go wild cutting holes.  These guys cut holes very fast and when they hit something, they will not pull your arm out of its socket, or break your wrist.  The just start impacting and pull right through.  The ring adapter make hanging this on your belt easy.  Then you also have the old quick lok tol cord that allows you to add a 25' long cord for real work and you have a heck of a tool.  Last thing, you can add a 7/16 insert that will allow you to use standard 1/2"" drive sockets and you can pull lugs off cars or spin nuts on hex bolts through beams in a flash.  Also once you get to the 1/2"" square drive, you can steps down to 3/8 sockets or 1/4 bit drivers.  These are great for driving your powerlags, headloks, trussloks, ledgerloks, etc.  A little heave for construction screws, but unlike cordless, they never run out of battery!  Adjustable torque and easy to use forward and reverse.... you do a lot of hole cutting and bolt running you will never miss this guy!",5
11/19/2018,9072-20,1/2 in. VSR Impact Wrench with Detent Pin Socket Retention,"This one, with the quick lok cord is the best.  You can add 25' of cord to the tool with the twist of your wrist and the not have to drag a knot to an extension cord with you on the 8 or 10' standard length cord.  I purchased mine for automotive work and equipment repair and with the 25' long cord on it, it has been more useful then I expected.  One thing you can do is add an adapter that takes you from the 1/2"" square drive to 7/16 hex quick change, Milwaukee makes one, and I hope they do not drop the part, because it will turn this into a hole drilling machine.  The impact is the best platform for running auger bits, especially the long ones, and you can also use the heavy duty Milwaukee extensions for drilling sole plates for piping with these guys.  The forward reverse above the trigger is great and there is also a variable speed dial for dialing down the tool that is good to have as well.  Great for an heavy duty automotive work, and great for drilling, and you can have 25' of cord from the tool.  Total win for the user.  Once you have one, you will use it a lot.

Only one con - if you look at this compared to the other quick lok corded version that had the 7/16 insert chuck attached to the tool, where you can insert the bit, or 1/2"" square drive to the tool, is this does not have the ring that allows you to easily attach it to a tool belt when in use.  KInd of a minor con, but the case has room for one to fit, and I ordered the parts for the ring and added one to mine.  

Previous posted said the nub on the square was annoying, bit that will depend on what you do.  If you do not want the socket to fall off, you will like nub.  It does mean you will need a small punch to disengage it.  One work-around is use a small extension to quickly flip between sockets. For me I you use the 1/2"" square to 3/8"" square step down for equipment repair work a lot, and it keeps that adapter on the tool, so I kinda like it.",5

It's on the left side on my back, (right where the rib cage curves around to the back) It's impossible to sit in a chair and lean back.

This thing cleared the line with 3 blasts. The drains run better now than they have in the 10 years I've lived here. I shot through the standpipe first which moved the plug past the kitchen drain connection so I put a test plug in the standpipe held a plunger one one side of the double bowl sink and shot the AirSnake down the other and it cleard the rest of the stoppage no problem.

12/2/2018,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","I have cut lots of wood in my day and decided to try one of these out after reading mostly favorable reviews.  I am glad that I did but have a few suggestions to improve this tool in future generations.

I come from using a midsize (around 45cc) and large Stihl chainsaw.  I am going to compare this on paper to a 45cc or bigger saw.  This is not a large saw and not meant to replace a large saw.  It is great for what it does and lasts a good long time and provides excellent power on battery.

My strengths and weaknesses on this saw are both the same.  The torque is great in most cases but there are times I wish I could dial the torque back a bit.  I want all the torque I can get when cutting larger logs but would like to knock it back a bit when limbing or cutting brush.  These smaller limbs that would normally stop a gas saw are no match for this torque monster.  It will either rip right through them or if they do snag, the chain will jump the bar.  I have the chain as tight as I feel comfortable and do not want it any tighter for fear of damaging the motor bearings.  In such cases I wish I could dial down the torque so it wouldn't do this similar to how you can set the torque on an electric drill.  I would rather have the saw stop when it snags than pull the chain off the bar.

I have only stopped this saw to where the motor overload kicks in twice so far.  Once was on purpose while I was testing its limits and once was while cutting.  If comparing this saw to my gas Stihl MS-250, this saw has a lot more power and TONS more torque!

Remember that we now have Tesla electric supercars!  Electric motors have been proven for decades and battery technology is finally able to back them up.  One issue with the Tesla is that with unlimited torque, you can literally destroy the tires in no time flat!  They actually have these cars detuned by default to prevent this.  I never though my biggest complaint about an electric chainsaw would be too much torque but there are scenarios where control over this would be nice.

Overall I am extremely impressed and happy with the saw.  I have no regrets and know I am an early adopter of a 1st generation tool so am not surprised there is room for improvement.  If you plan to cut mainly firewood sized logs, you will have no complaints at all.  For limbing, I might suggest a wimpy gas saw so you don't keep popping the chain off the bar when those 3/4 inch twigs snag the chain.

One workaround I found for limbing is that when the battery is down to the last 25% of its charge, you start to notice a drop in power.  The saw is still very usable but you know you are getting to the end of the battery before the saw just stops, much like when you run out of gas in a gas saw.  The reduced torque makes it less likely to pop the chain off the bar.",4

12/8/2018,48-22-8301,PACKOUT Backpack,"This is a good backpack. I gave this a 4/5 because some of the features that I have came to love in a competitor's backpack were lacking in this one, mainly zippered pouches on the sides, and the hard plastic bottom ran up higher on the bag so I can have it submerged in a deeper water without having the water touch the other material. To each their own. Mainly the lack of zippered pockets for the side. There are compartments on the side, but I feel more comfortable if they were in a zippered compartment, otherwise if something were to fall out you would probably not even realize until you reach your destination. Having them stored securely reduces that issue. 

The elastic inside did a good job of securing my  power tools, my two air ratchets. This can support a lot of weight and I am glad it has the hard bottom. Adds to the extra support and good for a task where there is water nearby. I just wished that area was expanded a little more and it ran higher up the bag. I used this on a job site with my cordless framing nailer and the inside pockets allowed me to stash strips of nail, without having to pack a separate container for them which was good. 

There are two grey carrying straps. Having two grey straps is a good feature as it takes the strain off having just one and reducing the chances of tearing that strap



Improvements:
 When I place my backpack down I usually just drop it down and all of the packout organizers that would fit on the bottom of this are small, so I feel that it would crush the slim organizers. I used it with the small organizer which had my tools in it and it held up but I would not want to keep dropping it on top of it often. So in that regards I would not see myself attaching anything to the bottom. If you do I would recommend carrying it by the two grey straps instead of on your back due to the added weight.  .",4

Runs them in and doesn’t get hot. We have used 6 3/4 screws by the box. The tool is a little heavy. Great product.

The pivot is so sloppy that the cutters will not bypass at times preventing them from closing all the way. Because of this they don't do a very good job of stripping either.

12/11/2018,48-22-2718,8pc Screwdriver Kit w/ Square,"I'll start my review by stating that I am accustomed to quality screwdrivers.  My previous set is a diamond tip screwdriver set. I discovered the Milwaukee screwdriver via their two-piece demolition set. Over time, I realized that whenever I needed a manual screwdriver, I reached for the Milwaukee demolition screwdrivers. I decided to try this 8-piece Milwaukee set. The screwdrivers in this 8-piece set are very well balanced. I did not recognize the balance until I held the Milwaukee and  my previous set side-by-side for the same size and type. In addition, the Milwaukee feels lighter and stronger. How does a screwdriver feel stronger, right? All that I can say is that the Milwaukee feels like the better engineered screwdriver.  I love the hex shank and the ends have a coating on them that makes them really grip the screw head.  Also, the handles are longer on the Milwaukee, which makes me feel like I have a more precise grip on the screwdriver. There are two cons for me:  (1) as the blade/tip size, e.g., PH1 to PH2 to PH3, increases, the Milwaukee handles do not increase in diameter as much as my diamond tip screwdrivers - you have better control with the larger-diameter handle, (2) the blade tip size (PH1, PH2, or PH3) is not stamped/written anywhere on the Milwaukee.  Yes, you can judge the blade tip size by sight, but I've become accustomed to have the size printed on the shank.  Nevertheless, the Milwaukee is still an excellent choice and has become my primary screwdriver set.",5

They are great grinders but for the price I'm paying per unit, its more cost effective to go back to the tried and true makita grinders. The thing that really chaps my rear end is the fact you cant get any replacement parts for them, including brushes. Ive called everywhere to try and get the small gear that wears out in the head and a set of brushes but nobody carries anything for repairing them. For that reason, I'm not overly impressed. We still have the same 8 year old makita in the shop (that costed $150) and gets used everyday, we throw a $10 set of brushes into it every couple months, a trigger switch every other year and it keeps on grinding.",3

Blown away by how sturdy the tool box is, you can tell by putting it together because you need to have two people just to put it together. very impressed with the soft closing drawers and the 4 inch deeper drawers as well, it makes a big difference. casters are also very well built and really easy to lock/unlock. Pretty much all of my opinions fall right inline with other reviews you can find on the internet, but of course as with anything nothing is perfect. I wish both power strips were on the left side and not the right, but that's just because of my personal situation. There are some tack welds on the front that could have been hidden better or at least with some kind of attempt to blend them in. and my tool box came out of the cardboard box dirty. someone who packed it up didn't have clean hands, and there are a few minor scuffs here and there; it is a tool box so cant lose sight of that and get carried away here. there's also a hook/loop on the inside of the lid on top that's kinda hidden didn't know about it till maybe a week after owning a box, this is great because with this large of a box/lid and light is gonna be very handy and there's already something to hang it on. Bottom line 90% of the reason you get the box you want is due to build quality and storage space, and Milwaukee hit the nail right on the head here. this box will last through my lifetime and hopefully someone else's.

This thing puts out an amazing amount of light in a pretty good sized area. And it is super clear light, not blueish and doesn't make everything look mono-colored. I love how I can plug it in too, this is a huge bonus for me. Very versatile, much better than those cheap flood tripods that everyone sells, this thing is brighter, and is much smaller and easier to work with. Man, I love this thing.

This Fuel version is better than the original as well; it runs harder, longer. With one 5.0Ah M18 battery we can cut almost all day without missing a beat.

I'm also not one for writing negative reviews, but I spend less time out on a jobsite (~30hrs a week) than most people who might be wearing this so I want give them the heads up. If I'm in the car or on the train, the jacket is very warm, but the second I'm outside I wish I had another layer on. It defeats the purpose of getting a heated jacket if I have to wear more layers with it than I wear with my unheated jacket in order to make it feel warm enough. I am also surprised at how large the battery is. I understand that in order to warm a jacket, there needs to be a decent amount of power, but with tech being what it is today I assumed it would at least be flat to fit in the back of a jacket instead of protruding whenever I wanted to sit back. The batter also makes the jacket pretty heavy. Lastly, it doesn't stay charged all day, even when I turn it off when I go inside to preserve the battery. If I want to be warm on my walk home at 8pm, I have to carry the charger along with me. It just seems like a lot of extra work. All in all, I've worn it for a week so I guess I'm not returning it...but I wish I had gotten a little more for what I paid.

about 30 seconds and turned it off to move some things. When I went to turn it on again, I heard it start but a different sound for about 2 seconds then it was dead. Ive tried everything I can do, different M18 battery, and nothing. Then I tried another and the same thing happened. So, l took all 4 back to the store for credit.

The M18 HD12.0 Battery was a welcome addition to my arsenal, and it definitely has the power I was looking for. I was on a job recently where a homeowner was concerned about a dead tree on their property, and although I didn't have the chainsaw with me, I used my M18 Sawzall with the HD12.0 Battery. I was worried that my Sawzall was going to overheat because it's not the Fuel version, but it actually ran great while I cut the tree down, and trimmed it into smaller pieces. Overall, this took about an hour and a half, constantly cutting the tree in different places(It would have gone much faster if I had my rough tree trim blade on). Out of my M18 5.0's & HO9.0, I'm massively impressed with the HD12.0. Some tools do take more of a toll on the battery life than others, but that's what the speed charger is for. If you don't have one, it will change your battery charging life. I would highly recommend this battery. GET IT!

I can jump in the car on a cold day and not worry about waiting for heated seats or the car to warm up.  It's perfect for any outdoor use and even stylish enough to use when not outside working.  I would highly recommend the kit as it comes with a USB charger.  If you're using it on high power, expect about 2-3 hours of consistent heat.

It does have a minor downside that was sort of expected.  The battery placement makes it awkward when getting into a car.  It is also a bit heavy which is okay because the material feels like it could take quite a beating.  All this aside it is definitely a 5 Star Milwaukee product.",5

Milwaukee advertises this saw as equal in performance to a gasoline saw.  This is absolutely true!  The power is great and battery life is surprisingly good.  The battery life is in harmony with the capacity of the bar oil tank.  Being able to just ""pull the trigger"" and start sawing is really great. The saw seems to be very robust and well made.

My second issue was how it would just randomly stop and I’d pull the trigger a couple times and it would start back up and go another minute or so and do it again and again and again.. needless to say I use it for small things now because it’s more of a headache on bigger jobs which is EXTREMELY disappointing!

12/31/2018,2736-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 8-1/4"" Table Saw w/ One-Key™ Kit","Milwaukee does it again.....with a table saw!!!!!

Yes, this is as powerful as a 15amp table saw including my GIANT Hitachi/Metabo table saw (known under side by side comparison (see pic).....this definitely could have been a 10inch platform, it has the power to be....and I am certain Milwaukee will deliver considering the Metabo 10inch multivolt is coming to the states in 2019.
Another comparison I was able to do was a side by side with the cordless ""yellow"" one....that was a COMPLETE joke, especailly in the power/RPM's and battery life department.
You can get 9 to 12 hours (depending on work pieces/load of course) on the Milwaukee m18 18 volt 12.0ah High Output vs the 60 volt flex****(Actual 
54 volts btw) and 2.0ah hours (maybe) running at 60 volts....and both batterys cost the same separately???
EVERY category about the Milwaukee fuel table saw vs the ""yellow"" one is greater....RPM's, build quality, size, power, battery life and ironically the rack and pinion fence system is smoother in operation, tighter build and does not sag when extended 24-1/2"" to the right....like the "" yellow "" one does.
Read professional reviews online...all agree.
Riving knife exchange is very clever on the Milwaukee vs having take the top of the saw apart. One wrench blade removal, dado support, two, not one, miter slots for your sled....the feature list goes on and on!!!!
There is nothing lacking from a 15amp saw...NOTHING.
PLEASE do yourself a favor and take a very close look at the comparisons I have layed out in this review, the info is all out there online, before going out and buying into a lessor cordless table saw at around the same price point.

I wrote to Milwaukee and on my own dime, shipped it to them as they were highly dubious of my ""it works for a couple minutes then shuts itself off"" claims. They said they tested it and found nothing wrong with it, treating me like a crazy person. It's clear they didn't care. They probably didn't even test it otherwise they would have seen the problem. Hopeful upon its return, it was still doing the same thing, on for a few minutes then shuts off. I followed all the cleaning instructions to a tee, even going so far as to line dry it rather than toss it in the dryer. Still to this day, on for a couple minutes, shuts itself off.

Normally, it's hard to find work-wear that isn't baggy with huge sleeves and large midsection making me look fat.This jacket is perfect.Durable, well-stitched, decently form-fitting (I took a chance in Medium), snug hood and quite great-looking! Combined with my Milwaukee No-Days-Off Hoodie, it's a fantastically warm combination. I do wish the hood extended a bit further out - perhaps with a small bill. Not a deal breaker. 

The Achilles Heel? The zipper. This otherwise near-perfect jacket is saddled with  a garbage zipper. It has completely stopped working after only two or three weeks of daily use. It will go up down but will no longer engage the two sides together. I am now forced to pay my local tailor $40 to replace the zipper so that my beloved jacket stops playing the role of a paperweight. I'm not the only one (as other reviewers have noted). This is obviously a defect.

The 90 tooth ratchet is perfectly balanced between head and handle and has a nice weight to it. The sockets themselves are clearly marked on two sides and fit snug to bolt and nut heads. Love the square base, allows the socket to be used as a pass through or to add a wrench for extra torque. I liked the 3/8 set so much I went and bought the 1/4 too.

1/6/2019,203B-20M,Men's M12 12-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless AXIS Black Heated Quilted Jacket (Jacket Only),"Useless Review Comments. 
* Fits me. 
* Heats up fast. 
* Does what is suppose to when battery is not dead.
* Battery bulges in back pocket. 

Useful Comments. 
* Intended purpose: Everyday casual wear (ie. non industrial) and to wear under ski jacket. 
* Medium is a bit roomy and fits my build of size 42 equivalent suit jacket due to shoulders, 40.5” chest, 34” arm length. This is due to an ironman athletic body with well developed deltoids, tres major and latissimus dorsi. 
* Axis is lightly insulated with polyester but has minimal to next to nil insulating value, without the heat aspect on.  
* Brand new battery was charged out the box for about 2.5 hrs in a 120 V outlet
* Turned on to low heat setting, which lasted 3 hours continuously.
* 2nd Battery charge & heat test: Turned on to medium heat setting, which lasted 2 hours continuously. 
* Did not bother to test on high heat setting. One review stated the battery lasts 1.5 hours on high.
* Definitely DOES NOT LAST “up to 8 hours of run time on RedLithium CP2.0 fully” charged battery, as stated on website, unless the jacket power was turned on without the heat turned on. At that point, it just a jacket with a ""bling"" red light on.  
* When Axis is on, it is warm, warmer and hot and serves its purpose as long as the battery lasts. 
* Believe jacket was intended for industrial use where multiple M12 batteries are constantly being charged and one can change it out every two hours (on medium heat) when they take coffee, lunch and coffee at the worksite. 
* Definitely does not serve the purpose of being outside in winter conditions for 8 hour ski day, when battery only last about 2 hours on medium setting, without carrying 3 additional M12 2.0 batteries. I researched that larger batteries will last longer, however what number one sizes of battery do you want to carry.
* No reduction in rating due to cylindrical battery in pocket because there is no other way to power a heated jacket, except maybe a USB power bank that is a rectangular block and different technology. 
* Would not even be a worthy liner jacket without the heat feature. 

 Regrets on 1 Star Rating
* I geniunely hoped the Milwaukee Tool M12 Axis heated jacket would last at least 4+ solid hours with 2.0 battery, even factoring the reduced life of a battery over time. 
* Other than the “up to 8 hours run-time’ stated on the website, I couldn’t find a review where someone gave factual info on actual run times tested at the three temperature levels.  
* Neither Home Depot staff, Milwaukee Tool technical representatives, nor Milwaukee Tool Canadian representative could provide a realistic estimated run time at any of the heat settings. The best information provided by Milwaukee Tool technical support was “approximately 2 hours on 2.0 battery but depends”. No comment on local Home Depot Staff and definitely refrained commentary on Canadian Representative.   
* Even if Milwaukee Tool read this review and gave me an Axis jacket for free for this honest review, I would be thankful and forgo the offer.",1

1/7/2019,2114-21,USB Rechargeable ROVER Pivoting Flood Light,"I love the convenience of this light, it's small, has good magnets, and has the pivoting light portion which makes it great for putting it pretty much anywhere and directing the light to where you need it.  The battery life seems to be as advertised and it's really nice and bright!",5
1/8/2019,0880-20,M18™ Wet/Dry Vacuum (Bare Tool),"We use this to vacuum filters for large communication routers and fibre optic transmission eqpt., etc.  We were shocked at the short run time which should have been printed as a chart for various batteries on the box to avoid this surprize; we are using a 6A M18 and get about 30 minutes turning it off & on. 
It is very loud and has an ear piercing frequency, so why is there no muffler available?  Also, there should be optional AC power as a back-up.  A lanyard to secure it when on a ladder would be a nice option.
Since we use many Milwaukee M18 tools, this was a good fit.  It is portable, has a good wet/dry filter, easy to use and maintain.  The vacuum itself is priced reasonably, but the larger batteries are expensive for the run time.  It has very good suction with a large capacity 'tank' which is easy to empty.
Other than the noise and lack of optional AC power it is a great product.",3

I used to love this grinder, but you have ruined it for me. As soon as I opened the box and saw the new design, I wanted to return it. I put it back in the box and decided to think on it for a while. I got it back out a month later and I still hate it and wish I could return it. I haven't even plugged it in. The new guard is cheap and the latch release sticks out past the end of the tool minimizing the working distance from the head. I may start buying yellow and black like the rest of the sheep.

1/9/2019,48-22-8426,PACKOUT™ Rolling Tool Box,"To start with, if Milwaukee considers these reviews it would be helpful for those who read them to see the company's response to consistent concerns.  In this case, the wheel issue seems to be a recurring problem and it does not seem that Milwaukee has acknowledged this concern, nor addressed the cost incurred by existing, loyal customers in dealing with what is clearly a design flaw.
I would personally like to see a little more transparency from Milwaukee on these types of concerns.

Secondly, the specs state that the unit height is 18.9 inches tall.  However, that is the box height, not the overall height (incl. the handle).  I found this out the hard way since my hard tonneau cover is 20 inches tall and I cannot fit the tool box under the cover without laying it on its side.  I will end up having to modify the handle to be flush with the top of the tool box.  I too am concerned about the Achilles heel for this unit being the wheels, and frankly for the money spent would expect Milwaukee to develop a retrofit solution for existing customers while improving the overall wheel design on future models sold.",3
1/9/2019,202B-21M,Men's M12 TOUGHSHELL Heated Jacket Kit,"I love my Milwaukee M12 Toughshell Heated Jacket.  I had thought about how nice it would be to have a jacket that has added heat that you can control, so I finally pulled the trigger on this and I have never been happier.  It provides a good amount of heat on high and helps with not being cold in the winter.  I like that it has pocket warmers that you can control independently from the jacket core heat.  I  got a 2nd Milwaukee battery as a secondary if I'm needing warmth for an extended period of time because the battery lasts around 3ish hours on high.  It's nice the portable power source charges the battery with micro usb and has indicator lights letting you know when it's charging and done charging, it also has a battery gauge that you can see how charged it is which is nice for gauging when to charge it.  The jacket is very high quality from the material to the zipper, I'm hoping it lasts a long time.  Overall very happy with my heated jacket.",5

1/9/2019,203B-20M,Men's M12 12-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless AXIS Black Heated Quilted Jacket (Jacket Only),"Jacket is awesome for being a heated inner shell by itself even when it gets cold during the winter in cold windy Montana. The only downfalls are the battery size & location but in all fairness you aren't supposed to be sitting when using the product you're supposed to be handling things & working. But even when putting the jacket on or taking it off it can be cumbersome but I guess it just takes practice & remembering about the power pack. I've swung my Axis on without thinking several times forgetting about the battery & got myself with the battery. But as for keeping you warm the jacket disperses heat great, heats up quick, & lasts long enough to get a task done on High setting. Just remember to not leave it in the car, etc since it is battery operated so that you don't have a dead battery when you need it! As for external portable power, it is sufficient enough to charge your phone while using the jacket for a bit which will vary on device charging specifications.",3
1/9/2019,233B-20M,Women's M12 12-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless AXIS Black Heated Quilted Jacket (Jacket Only),"I love my jacket, it disperses heat even without being powered. Love the fit. The only thing is the battery pack & location because it isn't huge but it isn't small either. Not to mention it doesn't mount or held in position, so if it isn't perfect it is a huge pain but even if it is it'll probably move. On the other hand this item is supposed to be worn when you're in the cold doing something, not sitting. Usually one isn't on their side or back in the cold but that does happen, if so then probably not the best product for you or forewarning that you'll have to improvise. Another negative is there isn't a hood, detachable or not the wind blows snow down the back of my neck pretty easy even when fully zipped up all the way. Another thing is that there are two outside pockets & one inner pocket plus the battery pocket in the description it states 3 outside pockets, 1 inner, & 1 battery which isn't the case.

He happened to be in the store and there was one womens jacket there and since he liked the fit and look of the women from Milwaukee when she had it on he decided to get me one. The only bad thing I have to say , along with every other review on here is the placement of the battery is very poor! It is directly on the back and hard to sit down. It is not a good place for this. I will keep this jacket because I probably will only wear it when I’m outside not inside sitting down.

The other day my nephew got keys to their first house.  Beautiful home but really needed new plugs and switches.  Anyway, my point is that we were switching the power to the house off/on.  It really bugged me that the light was not charging the battery during the time we had the power on.  To compare, we had my Dewalt radio/charger DCR025.  When the power was off it ran on battery and when the power was on it was charging the battery.  I feel that a work light is a much more vital piece of equipment than a radio.  I know I could just have another charger with battery ready but I have very high expectations of these great brands.  Please Milwaukee, please fix and make this great product even better.

Started building a smoker and needed the grinder to do some metal fabrication with a cutoff wheel and a 80grit flap wheel. 
Even with the 9.0 battery attached, it would cut out and I would literally have to rev up the grinder with the flap wheel to get it started again which would last for 1-2 min of grinding and it would cut off again. Eventually gave up and pulled out my old blue Ryobi with a 4.0ah lithium battery to finish up. Bringing it back to HD to see if they will swap it out. If so, I will update accordingly.",1

I love being able to easily turn it on and off as my temperature changes. I was worried I’d turn it on and it would quickly feel like I was cooking but it is a nice gradual heat. The battery is bulky but I wear my jacket sitting during my ride to work and just shifting it a bit the battery doesn’t bother me. I imagine next deer season with this jacket and a carharrt over it the battery won’t be much of an issue in my deer stand. A little bulk is worth 8hrs of heat!,4

Decided to give them another shot with the 18 gauge cordless nailer. This tool didn't even make it to a jobsite. I tested it in my garage on some scrap casing material. Straight out of the box and with a fully charged battery. The performance was extremely disappointing. After fiddling around with the depth adjustment I found that still about 50% of the nails were proud of the 5/8"" casing. The nails that did sink left a crater of a hole 3x the size of that left by an 18 gauge pneumatic nailer. I only managed to sink 1 satisfactory nails out of 100 shots. I immediately packed the nailer back up in the box and will be returning it tomorrow.",1
1/11/2019,MLBXC48,Milwaukee Starter Set,"Most Mil. tools I have I really like. My wife purchased these as a gift. The first set I received had had such deep scratches they wouldn't sit flat. Second set, the 48"" level was not true. 3rd set, the 24"" level is untrue and will have to be returned. I wanted high end good levels but sadly these have fallen very short. A massive look into the QA process is needed. I really wanted the digital level I've seen demos of on YT. I thought it would be out by now, but for some reason (possibly other QA issues) it is not yet for sale. 

For the good, the levels do feel solid, I really like the vials used, the rubber bumpers are nice and easy to remove (if done intentionally) and if I could find a set  that was true I think I would really enjoy them for a lifetime of use.",1

I just received my rolling tool box and decided to provide a metal hoop around the plastic inner hub as shown in the photo. I thought of using a geared hose clamp but there isn't enough width for a standard clamp. Also the hub isn't the same diameter across the width in this area, so heavy galvanized wire seemed to be a better solution.  I also added two 3/8"" washers on either side of the wheel so when the axle shifts and the wheel assembly hits the plastic box, it contacts at the stationary inner bearing sleeve, not the rotating wheel.  I also added a small amount of oil to the bearings so that the axle doesn't rotate, the wheel and outer bearing do.",4

But the as the other review suggests the end supports leave a huge amount to be desired. They keep falling off when being transported. They aren't locked on there very tight so if you want to transport the stand you pretty much have to take them off every time otherwise they get bent when moved around.

Because they are such a big feature on the saw for me (often cutting lengths of material 8 ft long) and loading and unloading the stand into the van a couple times a day I can't give this more than 2 stars.",2

I'm a picky guy and i can work around the couple issues with it because I know they are there so for me it's great. It needs a little higher ground clearance. When you lower the handle dont tilt it back and roll in the dirt. You contaminate the mechanism and it's hard to extend. It can be cleaned though. You can drop it off any kind of ledge or you will break it. So dont do it.  The handle is only attached with 2 little screws. Something better please. The bottom needs a aluminum skid plate so you dont destroy the bottom. The wheel bearing issue was resolved so far. The locking together boxes get jammed if you remove one and place it in the dirt. Dont do that. It's a good box I just work around this stuff. I love the trays too. Its holds my 8 batteries perfectly.just fix these issues milwaukee and you will have the best box out there!

Pro: Product is very nice, performs well and is portable, nice handles. amazing power in that HD12 battery!
Cons: The unit I bought had a rubber footing missing from one of the ends right after unboxing. I was disappointed because I chose the only box that appeared to have not been returned at the store (new tape on box seams, no evidence of it being a return). When you buy brand new you expect everything to be in the box.

But my biggest disappointment is that Milwaukee never thought it through to sell a dust collector bag. Goodness sakes, i’m using this saw in my basement, sawdust is getting everywhere. I don’t care about the money, but how do you enter a market where your competotors dewalt, bosch, etc all have similar units with dust collector bags, and zilch for Milwaukee! I tried tying on a plastic bag, but it doesn’t hold up right like a proper dust collector bag.

Anyway, if you want 5 stars sell a Dust collector bag, and make sure all components are in the box for customers who have loyalty with your products and basic expectations, please.",3

The amount of thought that went into its design is very admirable with this tool (as with most Milwaukee tools). I would love to get my hands on this to put it through it’s paces, genuinely curious how many joints can be done per charge/battery. You can bet it will carry a hefty price tag, which will likely still be competitive to corded versions made by the competition. Which might keep it out of my tool box for a while sadly but when I do get my hands on it I will be posting updates with its performance etc 

If you get a chance, do try this tool out - it’s a beast!

1/14/2019,2804-20,M18 FUEL™ ½” Hammer Drill/Driver (Tool Only),"I bought a new packout kit with this drill/driver included. When first using the drill, I noticed some wobble of my drill bit. It was an old bit, so I tried several others. It became VERY apparent when I tried using my pocket screw Kreg jig system. The metal sleeve doesn't let the drill walk - the drill/driver itself started wobbling.

I then proceeded back to where I bought it from to exchange for a new tool. The NEW one has the VERY SAME PROBLEM! 

Dumbfounded as could be as to how poor the chuck design is, I called customer service who forwarded me on to some tech support type people. The gentleman on the line was extremely professional and kind despite his lack of knowledge of the feedback on this website. He then explained that the tolerance on the tool was 0.012"" at 1.00"" on a calibrated rod. In other words, if your drill bit is 5 inches long, you could wobble approx 1/16"" and the tool is within tolerance. Seriously? 

Yes, seriously. Sad, I know. The other sad thing is that the only ones reading this feedback are probably marketing people. And, they're either not talking to the technical people or the technical people aren't listening. Either way, it sounds like you're losing customers FAST.

My old Dewalt drill holds a center just fine and doesn't behave at all like this drill.",1

If I remove the battery and put it back in, it would usually turn on. After having it in my pocket for a few minutes, it would no longer turn back on until I removed and replaced the battery. I finally realized that the zoom function on the light was causing the problem. I used electrical tape to keep the focus to the tight Focus and lo and behold the problem was solved.

I guess the problem is that I'm not obese enough to fill out a jacket big enough to have sleeves long enough for my 6'3"" wingspan. 

At the end of the day, you're better off spending half the money on a Carhartt jacket with sherpa lining. It's much warmer and you don't have an awkwardly placed battery that you have to remember to charge.",1

I ended up having to go with similar guns from DeWalt and Bostitch. Which stinks because most of my tools are Milwaukee.,3

This ""jacket"" is designed to be worn under a coat as a liner. It's got loops on the cuffs & back of the neck so that you can replace coat liner & attach inside of coat. That being said, it's not warm by itself or with a thin jacket over it, not on a cold MN day anyway. 

At first, I thought the battery location would be annoying but within seconds, I didn't notice it was there, even while driving. However; regarding the battery & the need to have another coat over this liner, it's a total pain in the rear end to change the battery! I had to take my coat off & take the Milwaukee ""jacket"" off in order to replace the battery. When is 9 degrees & windy, not a fun experience!

Have been using the Gen 3 for about 3 months now, and it's too much for most applications. For the majority of my daily tasks it slips off the screw, before engaging the impact, almost every time. It's useful for driving in drywall screws, and especially lag bolts and bigger applications. It's useless for tightening emt fittings, putting in devices, screwing in small wood screws, or anything that requires finesse.. I understand that I could've just bought the m12 hex impact for those applications, but having to carry two different impacts on me at all time doesn't sit right with me. Don't get me wrong, it does a lot of things really well, but not enough to justify the price tag..

I returned the saw for a new one and  same thing. Also fact that Milwaukee doesn't make a 12"" cordless & corded model like DeWalt is a huge downfall.

Before I got this we had a corded blue drill which is a great product in an of itself and for those that have used those I will say that this cordless drill from Milwaukee is as good and maybe just a little better as far as drilling is concerned.

A hole saw is screwed onto 5/18-18 threads on the end of the arbor.

A 1/4"" pilot bit in the end of the arbor guides the drill.  The pilot bit depth is adjustable for different length saws and is held in position by a 1/4-28 by 3/16"" long set screw.  It uses a 1/8"" Allen key.  Expose the set screw by pulling the collar down.

The saw is prevented from turning when in use by two pins on a sliding collar.  The collar is locked in the up position by a spring loaded latch.  You just slide the collar up and down, no tools required.
You shouldn't need to touch the spring loaded latch, but if you do and the pieces fly all over the place, here's how it's constructed: a 1/8"" ball bearing, a 1/8"" OD spring (approximately 0.2"" long), and a 8-32 by 1/8"" long set screw.  The set screw uses a 5/64"" Allen key.",4

The weight of the saw plus the large size of the foot plate make for a stable and safe cutting experience. I use various blades with teeth counts of 24 - 80 depending on what I'm doing and the saw eats through everything without problem. I'd recommend avoiding thin kerf blades as 1) the motor can handle a thick kerf and 2) thin kerf blades with this setup twist and deform too much while making long rips in big timber and actually bind and slow the saw down whereas the a thick kerf stays true and doesn't bind, letting you cut with less resistance.",5

They have come a long way as far as popularity, especially with the DIY’s. But also kept us professionals happy with the fuel line of tools. I bought the first tower light, it’s a good light but half the time I have power accessible so it was a pain keeping batteries for the light as well as several other tools on a job. Now that isn’t a problem with the new dual power tower ..it’s awesome ..it will light a large room if needed or focus a smaller area. 3 settings to choose from. If it charged batteries it would really be a must have for everyone. I’m buying another soon. Wanted a new rover but I’ll wait until they put out the new model.",5
2/4/2019,2108,300-Lumen LED Magnetic Flood Light,"This light is absolutely perfect in its size and functionality. Great light output on high mode, magnets actually work this time, rides very well clipped into the pocket - I had very high hopes for this light (I almost - almost - could make my peace with the outrageous $30 price tag!). That is why I am so disappointed in Milwaukee for the fact that the battery cap pops off with the slightest bump or twist, or rotation of the clip. Rotate the clip too far around (away from the power button), and the clip pushes on the cap, and off it comes. Wearing gloves while trying to adjust the belt clip? Better catch the cap before it falls down a vent or somewhere you’ll never find it. Then you’ll have a useless $30 piece of junk. This cap should have been attached with THREADS (like every other reliable flashlight!), not a 1/8 turn pop-top mechanism. This asinine feature makes this light no better than a $5 throw-away light. Also, there virtually no discernible difference between the High and Low modes. Low is just as bright as High (but is supposed to be 2/3 fewer lumens).

Milwaukee needs to put their products into customers’ hands and get bona fide user feedback (not their own developers’ input) before mass producing flawed products. 

I have had this light for one day, and it will be quickly going back from whence it came. Thanks for wasting my time with this one, Milwaukee!",1

My favorite feature is you set the pressure you want and it shuts off at that pressure.   Keep in mind, this is not meant to blow up completely empty tires, even though it could. This is meant to top off your tires, keep everything else up to par and do all the little jobs you used to have to haul the big compressor out for.  This is well worth the $70 I paid for it.

2/8/2019,2135-20,M18 ROCKET™ LED Tower Light/Charger (Tool Only),"Nice, bright light, easy & fast to set up. 
Saw a ""Rocket"" light a couple of years ago & thought it was a great idea, finally decide to step up & buy one! 
I Wasn't planning on spending as much as I did, but this model is the brightest one available & it has three light modules which can be aimed independently instead of just one. Plus it is dual-power so it can be plugged in to save & charge the battery if AC power is available (It has a charger built in).
Overall I think it was worth the extra money for the added features, it's a great light.
Only one negative:
The side handle appears to be the same design as the single head lights without the charger. With the added weight of the charger in the base of this light, it is bottom heavy & won't stay level when being carried. It's even worse with a large 12.0 battery installed in it. This is not a huge problem, just thought it was worth mentioning.

2/8/2019,48-22-9214,4pc Pry Bar Set,"Claiming up to 40% more prying strength and seemingly attributing that to the I-Beam design of the steel shafts I presume that the claim is compared to non I-Beam designs.  That might be true but speaking from experience I can get more prying power from the 18 inch Milwaukee bar when compared to another good quality 18 inch pry bar I own but the advantage, as far as I can tell, is due to the bigger angle on the prying end.  The Milwaukee bar has a 24 degree angle and my other bar only has a 20 degree angle.  There was another difference between the two 18 inch bars.  The Milwaukee bar is a true 18 inches in length and my other (very expensive) bar came up short at 17 ½ inches!

The solid metal I-Beam core runs all the way from the pry end to the striking cap and that is good design.  The steel is chrome plated for protection and longevity.  The tri-lobe plastic handles are comfortable to hold.  The 24 inch bar has a rubber like protection cover on the sharp end for safety.

The packaging is designed to be the tool storage as well.  This is a useful feature because if a bar is not in its place and not known to be in use it serves to remind me to find the bar and retrieve it.  Each of the bars, 8 inch through 24 inch lengths comes with a Milwaukee lifetime guarantee.",5
2/8/2019,2504-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/2"" Hammer Drill (Tool Only)","I'm in general aviation so I prefer a high rpm, good trigger modulation and light weight/compact. I love this drill, however if you plan to use this drill for a lot of low torque fasteners as I do then you'll find the electronic clutch inferior to a mechanical one and the slow start at lower clutch settings extremely annoying. Also the chuck will spin the whole drive train before you can get a proper clamping force on the bit. Again I'm I general aviation so 90% of the work I ask this drill is a 1/8th inch drill bit in 2117-T4 aluminum. For my work  it's great when you have a lot of rivets to drill as I frequently do.

2/8/2019,2758-20,"M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 3/8"" Compact Impact Wrench w/ Friction Ring (Tool Only)","Unfortunately, M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 3/8"" Compact Impact Wrench w/ Friction Ring (2758-20) does not have the performance I was expecting based on the Milwaukee's specs I had researched prior to purchasing it from Construction Fasteners.

According to Milwaukee’s website, my M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 1/4"" Hex Impact Driver (2757-20) only has 1,800 inch pounds of torque (see attached) which equates to 150 foot pounds of torque while the M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 3/8"" Compact Impact Wrench w/ Friction Ring (2758-20) has 210 foot lbs of torque. (see attached)

So according to Milwaukee’s specs, the M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 3/8"" Compact Impact Wrench w/ Friction Ring (2758-20) should have 60 foot pounds (210 minus 150) more torque than the M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 1/4"" Hex Impact Driver (2757-20).

However, while testing both of these tools today side by side each with 5.0 AMP batteries attempting to drive in a 3/8 x 6 inch GRK into LVL, my M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 1/4"" Hex Impact Driver (2757-20) BEAT the M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 3/8"" Compact Impact Wrench w/ Friction Ring (2758-20) hands down. It was not even close contest. In fact, the M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 3/8"" Compact Impact Wrench w/ Friction Ring could NOT spin the 3/8 x 6 inch GRK after it was about 2 inches into the LVL. I was REALLY surprised.

I was really hoping the M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 3/8"" Compact Impact Wrench w/ Friction Ring (2758-20) would have been quite a bit superior to the M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 1/4"" Hex Impact Driver (2757-20) considering it is supposed to have 60 more foot pounds of torque as I require something that efficiently drives these type of fasteners more effectively & efficiently.

In the mean time, until I can find something that is faster & more efficient than my current M18 FUEL™ with ONE-KEY™ 1/4"" Hex Impact Driver (2757-20), I will keep searching for the appropriate tool to this task.",1

2/13/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","So far so good.

I bought the M18 Fuel chainsaw with two 12 AH batteries recently at a special price from Home Depot. I have been using it 3 weeks.  I was hoping it could replace my gas-powered 16” Husqvarna 345 for cutting small to medium (6”-14” diameter) pinon and juniper trees for a multi-acre forest thinning project in New Mexico.  So far so good. This is a project where I cut about 2 hours/day so note this review is not for long hours of daily saw use.  Attached is a photo of a patch I cut with the M18.  I was leery about claims that a cordless could replace a small gas chainsaw.  I am very pleased with the M18 - it cuts with comparable power to my Husqvarna but without the gas, 2-cycle oil, and very loud engine noise.  I use it to cut down trees, cut their stumps, cut the branches off the trunks, and cut the trunks into firewood logs.  The M18 is responsive, cuts through wood easily as long as the chain is sharp, quieter than a gas chainsaw (not whisper quiet, similar to a circular saw, I still wear ear protection), and has not over-heated. My estimates of battery run time: (1) smaller trees 4”-8” 50 minutes; (2) larger trees and stumps 8”-14” 30-40 mins.  A tank of gas in my Husqvarna lasts 45-60 mins depending on what I am cutting, so one 12 AH battery lasts somewhat less. Getting two 12 AH batteries was key for extended saw use.  If their price comes down I will buy more batteries.  I have not kept track how long it takes to recharge the batteries.

I chose the M18 over other cordless brands based on reviews, claims of it performing comparable to a gas chainsaw, its 12 AH battery, and that the bar is attached to the saw with two bolts, which is standard in gas chainsaws.  Although I was tempted by other brands that have tool-less chain tensioning, I was worried that the bar would be less solidly attached to the saw.  I don’t know if that worry is warranted.  If the M18 had a tool-less tensioner and the bar was solidly attached to the saw I would have preferred that setup.

My only questions so far relate to how the bar and chain oil is distributed.  Oil soaked saw chips stuff the space behind the clutch cover when using the saw.  That does not seem to reduce cutting performance but I still remove the cover and clean out the chips every so often.  I  wonder if that could be fixed with a better design?  The other question is that I wonder how well the oil is getting to the bar and chain.  When running the saw, oil is not obvious on the chain as it is with my gas saw, and when I point the end of the bar at a light color object like a board and run the saw it does not sling an obvious oil line as with my gas saw.  Instead it spits out a scattered small oily spots/saw dust chunks.  I have to run the saw through two batteries, about 1-1.5 hrs, for the oil tank level to drop substantially.  I removed the clutch cover and bar and ran the saw and it is putting out oil so the oil pump is working.  The oiler holes in the bar and the ports from those holes to the bar groove are not clogged, so that does not seem to be a problem.  It does not seem like the saw chips that accumulate behind the cover would interfere with oiling since they are above and below the chain, not clogging the bar oil holes.  Unless the chips get past the chain and into the bar groove and clog oil dispersal there.  I’ve only checked the groove once so far and it did have some some gunk although I did not think it was excessive. I called Milwaukee support and they said that when the M18 saw first came out there were complaints about oil leakage (I read that in reviews) so on newer saws they dialed back the amount of oil put out, and support said it is not a problem.  I have not noticed any problem with cutting performance, overheating, or chain bluing and I am glad it does not put out excess oil.  On the other hand I worry that if there is insufficient oil, chains and bars will wear out faster.  Does anyone have an opinion on this?

Also, I am going to try Stihl BioPlus vegetable-based bar oil.  Not for this question about sufficient oiling, but because I am just interested how it will perform in the M18.  Has anyone tried it in the M18?  Some people report problems with vegetable-based bar oils jamming oil pumps or otherwise being inferior especially when cold, but that is in gas powered chainsaws.

Anyway, overall I am very pleased with the M18 and will see how well the saw and batteries perform over time.",4

2/17/2019,2554-20,M12 FUEL 12-Volt Lithium-Ion Brushless Cordless Stubby 3/8 in. Impact Wrench (Tool-Only),"I use this product as a mobile mechanic. I thought I was going to really enjoy the upgraded torque of the stubby but boy was I disappointed. It absolutely smashes through the 2.0 and 4.0 batteries. Voltage drop and amp capacity makes a huge difference with torque as well so a xc 4.0 or better is a must, sticking to the 3s1p battery packs will severely limit it's overall performance. With a fresh 4.0 or 6.0 battery, it can pull head bolts off no problem as long as it is fully charged. With it half charged, no way, the performance drop off is two much, my gen 2 3/8's m12 impact outperforms it with a half charged battery. 

I recommend the M18 1/4"" impact 2853-20 personally. It's 2000 in/lb (166ft/lb) torque spec is definitely under rated. It rips off wheel and suspension parts incredibly fast and with less stress than the m12 stubby. The head is also much smaller on the M18 that I have found it more useful in my mobile mechanic bag than the M12 stubby. The weight of the M18 is about the same as the stubby when using a M12 4.0 battery in the stubby and a 5.0 battery in the M18, the weight is better distributed too, resulting in less wrist fatigue. My only complaint is that it is 1/4"" hex and not 3/8"" or 1/2"" square but with the same body.",2

You may think knocking it 2 stars for that is harsh, but it really does reduce it's usability if you have to be worried about not touching it while you are working lest you break it's weak magnetic hold. If Milwaukee would put stronger magnets on it, it would be an easy 5 stars.  As it is, I wish I had figured this out before throwing the packaging away.",3

3/1/2019,2475-20,M12™ Compact Inflator,"The size, power, quality are great, but some basic design flaws cause recurring annoyance.  
First and foremost, especially because I purchased this to pump bike tires, I don't want to have to screw the nipple onto the valve every time I use it. I want to press, hold and release when full. Even a nipple lock would be satisfactory.
Secondly, most of our bikes use a Presta valve. The adapter included is cheap plastic and with almost every inflation, the rubber o ring comes out or gets mangled.
Finally, every time you turn the power button on, the desired pressure setting resets to 0.  That is ridiculous and lazy as far as the developers are concerned in that they don't want to take the time to develop a little energy store (like a cap or something) to retain power to the pcb.
Other than these issues, it's a great little machine.",3

First things first; charge up a battery – very quick, just 34 minutes to full charge – and then add this tool to the excellent ONE-KEY app inventory.  That way it can be tracked, disabled, enabled and more all from a smartphone.

Next up, a couple of crimps to see how this tool performs.  Select the right die and install in the crimping jaw … there’s a problem!  One of the die release tabs was laid on the bench.  The circlip holding the pin had come off.  Closer inspection showed it to be stretched apart too far to hold the pin properly.  I don’t think I have ever had any of my other Milwaukee tools fail right out of the box.  Indeed, it is very unusual for M18 tools to fail at all even after years of use – I have at least eleven of them.  It was a problem soon fixed for just a few cents.

So, on with the demo; install the die, insert the connector and the wire and pull the trigger.  The Predictive Force Monitoring feature ensures the right amount of pressure is used for the perfect crimp regardless of the size of the die and materials used.  The photos show the tool in use.",5

So I bought the M12 Trapsnake for urinals.
Straight away I thought the cable was too thick.

First blocked urinal call - it would not go around the cast in urinal trap.  

The Drill snake comes with a 1/4” diameter snake which is super flexible: 

I think the trapsnake should be 1/4” also as so many urinals have tight traps.

The biggest TURNOFF was that when someone was by it or if you put any other electronic next to it the sound would go down and you would get static! That in itself is just wrong and NO reason for it! The radio industries has made, noise suppressor,  capacitors,  inductors, or whatever to suppress static and at this price it should be of better quality!

Hated the NiCads, bought more used v-18 tools after I got the Li-Ions. They work great.  Longer user time, much longer time holding a charge between uses, provides more power to the tools.  Key info, don't let the batts completely run down.  I used to be a regular, almost daily user, not so much any more.  The charge lasts more than 2 months with no use, so about every 4-6 weeks of no use, I make sure to give them a charge. Seems the internal electronics don't like it when the batts completely discharge.  Anyway, somewhat regular maintenance keeps them going.  Yes, the newer M-18 line of tools are fancier, smaller, brushless etc., but I have hundreds invested in still working V-18s that still work great and I can get additional used tools on ebay. When I bought these 2 batts, the pair was about the price of a single one now. (supply and demand). Give the original version 5 stars, but I'm looking for a better price or a possible knockoff.",5

For those cuts that have to be exact and straight the saw is useless. Try ripping a board from end to end by using the notches on the guard and it will be crooked every time. The way i cut is to eye the blade on the pencil line and it is impossible to see with this saw. I have handed it to all 5 guys that work for me and they still grab the old 6 1/2 over this every time. Label this as a left handed saw or say the blade is on the opposite side. Yes i have tried to use it and get used to it but when you have been using a saw for so many years it is annoying to have something so different. I am kinda surprised all 7 1/4 saws are this way, can a engineer please explain to me why? or who's bright idea it was because i guarantee you would sell more saws if you swapped the blade to the opposite side.",1

While it has great portability and suction, I think Milwaukee missed the mark on its advertised function of dust collection, specifically fine masonry and drywall dust. Small amounts of drywall dust immediately clog the filter. This vac would be absolutely awesome if it had a dust collection bag. It's counterintuitive and counterproductive to have to remove a filter, and blow it out with compressed air in order to restore function. Why care about HEPA filtration if I have to create a giant dust cloud and release that dust into the air so I can have a working vacuum again? I'm really hoping Milwaukee can engineer a dust bag, or a solution to the clogging problem. After reading many reviews, I'm not the only one having this issue. I'd be happy to talk to a Milwaukee rep about this.",3

On the drill, the trigger hits the forward/reverse switch when in the forward position when the drill is turned to the right even a little.  There is so much slop in the switch that it allows the trigger to hit it internally when depressing the trigger and you get a loud click as it forces the switch out of the way.  Even playing with the drill for two minutes, the handle got so warm it was uncomfortable and I think you'd have to wear a glove to use the drill for any period of time.  Also, one of the batteries would not charge.  This is the only review I've ever left, and the only tool I've ever had to return.  Terrible quality.

All my big tools are M18 so it was practical to use something with the same battery.  She loves it, Except.  The 1.25"" extension tube won't stay together because of the great suction power at the floor.  Also 1.25"" tube does not match the 1.25"" tube of any of our other vacuums, it is just a little bit larger. (as if one measures OD and one is ID at 1.25).  This could mainly be fixed by making the extensions click, screw, or attach in some way to each other and the vacuum so they don't pull apart.  Also if Milwaukee sold a full length extension as an accessory to use in addition to the 2 piece tubes that would be helpful.",4

Suction isn't bad (not close to the suction of a corded vacuum). It was able to pick up most of the materials I tried.  Unfortunately it plugs up way too easily. It seemed OK with coarse saw dust. Things like a wood chips, shavings, scrap of paper, a dried leaf will plug the hose (The opening where the hose attaches to the canister is smaller than the opening at the other end of the hose), fine dust will plug the filter.
 Run time was hard to determine, due to constantly having to unclog it (I'm guessing 5 minutes on a 5aH battery).",1

For one the built in handle is completely non functional when you have a battery installed. It looks like this light is a copy of the M12 version and they didn't take into account or try a M18 battery on the light before they out it into production. The other issue is also battery related. When you install a 9.0 ah battery, the battery protrudes past the base of the unit and this won't allow you to utilize the magnets on the bottom of the unit.

The tool is heavy but it is pretty well balanced and very easy to use, successfully cutting cable time after time after time.

1st off, I love the body design (& and that it's Milwaukee. Go RED!).This last one I bought, had problems straight out the Box. I was unable to cut anything, Even after tightening them down as much as possible. The blade was still very loose. (I was a little confused)
 So I took it upon myself to see what was going on, and took the head off and Disassembled it, turns out the ""1n 42-40-0528 Spacer Bushing"" Was too long in the middle area, which is Why I was unable to tighten them to where the blades were touching. 
 

PRO's: It has a great body design 

CON's: 
• I don't like how much movement the head unit has while cutting (its because of the rotating head on it. Just wish there wasn't any play (movement) in the rotating head, makes it hard to cut in a long straight line.

•It really need an integrated spot to keep the hex wrench that comes with it.

2) battery cap start popping off after you try to stick it with magnet to a metal surface or after small bump..  small turn of 1/8 inch it what is holding battery cap and light together.. make it really easy to loose or break it especially when you  are electrician or construction worker.

The markings are clear and legible on both sides and the tape is not too glossy so if you're outside you won't get too much of a glare. The belt clip is stout enough that i haven't had any issues with it since it's mage out of wire and not that cheap spring type you find on others. One issue I have is that the tape gets dirty quickly and looks old before it gets old. I do wish that number where set up differently to where when i pull the tape to make marks or to use in a picture they were reversed. All in all this is a good tape measure and would recommend in a maintenance shop setting.

Of course you need 9.0 or 12.0Ah when running their new table saw.  And you want a 2.0 for your 1/4 impact drivers.  But these 5.0 batteries see the most use.

4/4/2019,48-22-8200,Jobsite Backpack,I am an electrical apprentice and was given this bag as a gift. A few years ago I was actually shopping around for the Klein bag but realized not for what I needed it for. Then around the same time out comes Dewalt trying to outdo everyone as they try to. Got to admit there bag wasn't half bad till I realized EVERYONE had them. So I mentioned to my boss about the Milwaukee bag and more so the packout(but he said o e thing at a time.). Well I have had no complaints it is fairly heavy but the straps are awesome for distributing the weight. Thanks Milwaukee can't wait though till I get my packout.,4

4/5/2019,2361-20,M18™ ROVER™ LED Flood Light (Tool-Only),"I was debating what light to get for some time and chose this model.  It’s been fantastic thus far.  Great for power outages, workspace, and even as an impromptu photo session light (for that last use, I recommend pointing it at the ceiling to act as a diffuser).  One note, it does eat through the 1.5 Batteries in about two hours on Dim.  I recommend the 5.0 Batteries as they will last much closer to that advertised 10 Hour Dim setting runtime.  

The one drawback I have is, while Milwaukee advertises a “stand mount”option, I cannot find a stand, at least by Milwaukee, designed to hold this light.  I could always craft one, but hoped there was a specific option to take advantage of the hole that’s intended to mount it.  Maybe I’m just not looking in the right places.",4

Works great to get into tight spaces as it was designed.  It isn't a high torque tool.  The Hole Hawg and Super Hawg (which I own) are for rough in work.  Self feed spade bits are trendy right now but they require much more torque than regular spades that you can control the feed rate with.  This is the right tool when normal drill drivers won't fit in the space.  Works great for that.  I've used it and the M12 version(which I own) numerous times with a hole saw to cut both wood and 1/4 in mild steel.

4/8/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","This is an update on my previous review ""So Far So Good"".  Good and Bad news: The good is that I've found after further use of the saw that the battery lasts a little longer than I last estimated, an average of about 1 hour in the field cutting.  The bad is that the rear bar bolt - one of the pair of bolts that secures the clutch (bar) cover and bar to the saw, stripped so that when you try to unscrew the nut it does not come off the bolt, instead it spins the bolt.  This renders the saw useless because you cannot adjust the chain tension or remove the cover to replace the chain.  This saw is barely 2-1/2 months old so it is very disappointing.  I did read in one review a complaint that to get the bar nuts snug they dig into the cover.  I have noticed the bar nuts are indeed difficult to tighten while guarding against over-tightening.  I returned the saw to Milwaukee to be repaired.  I have lowered the my previous rating to 3 stars because of this problem, even though I think the saw performs very well.  Hopefully Milwaukee will do a satisfactory repair job so this problem will not repeat itself.",4

Also a lack of an adjustable head. I used pole saws with that feature and it is very helpful.
This has two settings(another small issue is that the icons for the both settings are white and they are illuminated by a white light, so using this on a sunny day and it is difficult to see which mode you are in(see pic below). Even on the lowest setting, I found that this had more than enough power to cut my tree limbs in a fast and clean manner. For all of my limbs I used the slow setting(Turtle) and it got the job done. I felt no need to put it on the higher setting(Rabbit). I only used the higher setting once just to test it and it definitely cuts faster. The pole saw felt good to me, not too heavy. I had an older co-worker try and it out and she commented on how manageable it was to use.

during the peroid of time when we sent it off, we need a propress tool, thinking that milwaukee was going to cover the tool under the 5 year warranty. I bought a second one. Later on found out from milwaukee it was denied warranty. this is what they wrote in the service packing slip.

 warranty denied. lever on the retaining pin was installed upside down so the locked position, the pin was not locked, if lever was not installed properly from factory it would have failed the first few times the tool was used.

Have used to inflate large boat fenders, bike tires, motorcycle tires, sports equipment/balls, everyday items.   I have the M12 XC 6.0 battery that runs the compressor very well.  (Side Note: The M12 3/8 ratchet is fantastic)

Suggestions/Complaints: 

A) The ability to disconnect the air hose from the body of the compressor would be suggested.   The air hose cannot be removed without disassembling the compressor body it appears.  

B) The 'accessory connections' tool storage is an open air 'snap' in for the 3 plastic connections that come with the compressor.  These plastic connector threads easily gall or strip.  I ordered brass replacements, however, the 'storage' should be a 'box' of sorts that has a lid to close instead of an open face snap in, so that more than 3 connectors can be stored of various sizes securely.   

Those two items would make this 4.5 stars.",4

4/22/2019,48-22-5525,Magnetic Tape Measures,"I had my 25' tape measure extended 8' or more, and let it rewind without limiting it or doing the rewind in increments.  Foolish me.  The result was a slap on my hand and a tear in the tape at the 3 1/2"" mark, see photo.  The force bringing the tape back in was so great it tore itself when the tape was not in a straight line.  The tear now causes the tape to catch on the sides of the unit when trying to extend it -- I have to push down on the tape to keep the torn edge from catching on an edge of the case or guides.  This tape has a very limited life ahead of it now.

I do not know if one can build a tape measure that does not break on uncontrolled recoil.  

A peeve -- the tape is very curled.  I suppose it has to be for a 25' unit.

I might see what other brands there are before I replace this unit.  I may not even buy another 25' as it seems just too much.  I have the 16' Milwaukee and no problems.  I just feel badly having spent the money for something I thought would endure and to have it snap on recoil and tear itself seems like a design limitation.  Yes, I was at fault -- but I have not had this problem with smaller units.

4/24/2019,2106,Alk Headlamp,"Jeez, I mean c'mon Milwaukee.  I guess it's possible that I got the  1/1000 of this headlamp that happened to be truly worthless, I always try and give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  I bought it because, well let's face it there's Milwaukee written on it.  I was looking for the rechargable model at home Depot, but the AAA battery powered one was all they carry.  I own a flooring company, so I buy a lot of tools and go through a lot as well.  I have been buying Milwaukee products since 1996, shoot I STILL have a working angle grinder made back in 1980 when they first introduced it into their line of power tools!! I even kept buying Milwaukee after TTI got the company and then outsourced a lot of 
 production to China and closed several USA based facilities.  I can honestly say that I've had hardly any issues with their equipment, until I bought this freaking thing.  Opened it, excited, and as soon as I turned it on (about 60 to 120 seconds after) the ""my batteries are toast"" blinking began.  So okay, sometimes these things sit around a while before finding a home I'm sure the batteries are just old, so I went and opened a brand new pack of Energizer batteries and put four other rechargable energizers in the wall charger.  The disposable batteries worked for about 10 minutes before the headlamp began to dim and start blinking.  I, completely like ""what the heck?"" got my battery tester and the disposables were still at 71% battery life??  Thought maybe just a glitch ( dag gone benefit of the doubt) so I put the disposables back in and imediately the lamp is dim and blinking.  Two hours later I put 3 brand new charged to 100% energizers in that thing and got 13 minutes of use on medium brightness out of them before the lamp cuts off.  Test batteries... 74% battery life!?  So not only is this thing consuming too much battery life it absolutely HATES running on anything but fresh and full batteries.  All of this =  worthless.  I emailed you guys too explaining in more detail and less sarcasm all of this and never got a response.  So, maybe you other consumers will have more luck?  I don't know, this is just my experience.  But I gotta tell you guys, this has had an impact on my opinion of Milwaukee.  Especially not getting a reply.

I have never had a Milwaukee tool let me down in any way. I also own a Stihl 036, and a Husqvarna 350. I bought the M2727 as soon as I could after its introduction. Its the only saw I grab now. Ive cut down and sawn into firewood trees as big as 14 inches, and it’s the almost equivalent in power to my gas saws. But the greatly reduced noise, no fumes, no mixing of fuel, sitting it down and just picking it up and pressing the trigger and going, trust me you’ll love this saw!!",5

First off i like the size of the tool an i feels great in my hands as it hammers even the hardest of surfaces.

Once apart I easily use the spare parts to fix vehicles or other apparatus that we need day to day. One of the keys is to not destroy the T800's fully but this little puppy gets the job done. A+ great job Milwaukee!,5

5/3/2019,2111-21,USB Rechargeable Hard Hat Headlamp,"Ive buying them slowly for the plant employees where i work. Each time one of the old ones break i replace it with one of these and an additional battery/ charger kit. So when any one of the plant guys lights needs a battery they just swap it with one in a charger. Most of the guys use it on high so they battery life is kind of short but thats expected and why i bought the spares. Still they only have to swap batteries every couple days. With a 2000 cycle life span frequent swapping wont be an issue for a long time. 
   As for function, I use mine as a mobile work light and headlamp. You can remove it from its plastic mount and sit it where you need it. Im not sure if its meant to be that way but im careful and its worked perfectly at least 100 times. Its been about 9 months to a year since i bought mine (the first one at the plant) and i still havent found any major flaws. One weak point is the battery life if used on high flood (approximately 2 hours) all of the time. My resolution is the spare battery and charger kit which is fully charged in that amount of time. So i dont see that as much of a weak point. just get the kit and you have a great work light for around $100.",5

For its size this light is VERY bright and lights a very wide area. I'm a serious milwaukee loyalist so that just made the purchase so much easier. Once i got it back to work and found just how well it suited my trade (i'm an aircraft mechanic / avionics technician) i was in love. This thing will light up an entire engine, or the entire backside of an instrument panel from countless angles. I later saw it online in a package deal available at the time that included an additional battery and charger for roughly the same price. Upset that i had missed out on the deal i bought an additional one for myself (for home) and one for both of my technicians as a gift. In the end i bought 8 of these lights and gave them to friends as gifts. Everybody LOVES them. This light replaces the traditional ""drop light"" with more light, no cords, and around 2-2.5 hrs run time on high.
GREAT JOB MILWAUKEE!!!!",5

This little guy lights up a decent size room to do work in a color temperature that is easy to see. My brother and I both bought this light the same week without talking to each other, one of many reasons is it’s ability to be plugged in or run on battery power. I’ve been using M18 tools for almost 10 years and this is my first M12 product, but I have to say for the price and usefulness this is a must have for any trade! Compared with 2 65w flood lights in the middle of the night and this is most definitely brighter by a considerable amount. If your looking for a light you’ll love look no further.",5

If you’ve ever tried that then you know what I’m talking about old days lots of stripped heads an had to stand on ladder so I could put all my weight behind old style driver.

Although, I can buy the caulk I need in 20oz tubes; bulk caulk is cheaper. I was using a JES 20oz/Bulk Caulk Gun prior to purchasing the Milwaukee.

I only got to use it on job a couple times before I had to shift to a different type of construction that didn’t require as much cleanup, however I was very impressed with the power it had, as well as the long run time, ( using the 9.0 amp batteries).
Now that I’m making messes again on the job site, I use it almost everyday, that is when my employees aren’t grabbing it to use, so they don’t have to use the old corded shop vac. HaHa. 

The only thing I wish it had was a longer hose for the times I don’t need to wear it, and just need to clean a spot across the room real quick.

That being said, I don’t really see that as a complaint. And that is why this is still the handiest tool I own!

Sometimes I'll rent it, if it is a big enough item or something I'll use only once.

When I needed to bore some 4 "" holes through some 2x12s, my old 3/8"" drill just wasn't going to do it, cord or not. So because I had already decided to never buy cheap tools again and I already had really fine experiences with some other Milwaukee tools, and this drill came as a package deal with a smaller hammer drill and an EXTRA battery, I took a leap of faith and bought it. It made quick work of six 4"" holes and still had plenty of charge left in the battery.So I thought ""What the heck,over"" and proceeded to drive about 20 1/2"" x 6"" Lag bolts with it. No sign of battery fade. I've got an antenna tower project coming up that needs about 60 good size bolts installed so we will see if the battery hangs tough through that,too.

5/16/2019,2820-21PS,M18 SWITCH-TANK 4-Gallon Backpack Sprayer Kit,"There is good and bad with this sprayer...

The Good....
1. It’s built like a tank. Every aspect of this sprayer is solid and Milwaukee tough. I love the variable settings and location of the on/off switch.
2 This might seem small but it’s easy to reach and grab the wand when you have it strapped to your back. I always had to use my foot to lift the wand to my hand when using my Chapin battery powered.
3. I love the way the battery is completely isolated and protected from any liquid hitting it.

The Bad....
1. This thing is HEAVY. I don’t mean a little heavy.... I mean it is HEAVY. The weight of the full tank is not distributed properly and the straps curve in toward the neck so there is a constant strain where the neck meets the shoulder. I got about 1/3 done with my yard and gave up on carrying it. I put it on my Exmark and rode for the rest of my yard.
2. The connection where the hose meets the trigger/ wand is fixed so I was having to rotate my wrist against the pull of the hose. It’s extremely uncomfortable. Milwaukee could correct this with a swivel mount.
3. It started off great but started dripping and running out of the spray nozzle when the tank got down to about 1 gallon.
4. The brass spray nozzle is heavy and makes for a very uncomfortable experience when combined with point number 2.",2

I usually prefer to buy products made in the US, but I’ve been so impressed with Milwaukee’s quality of late that I started looking that way for screwdrivers. 
The drivers in Home Depot have a triangular handle which allows for high torque, but makes it uncomfortable and somewhat ineffective to turn rapidly if you have a long screw, etc. The tips are very soft and easy to notch out. Additionally, the quality is obviously inferior, thus the $20 price point. If I remember correctly, those models are made in China. 
This product on the other hand is made in Taiwan. And from the tools that I have, some of Milwaukee’s very best products seem to be coming from there. These screwdrivers are a direct competitor to Klein for me. I own many Klein screwdrivers and love them, but have been buying a good bit of red for my toolbox. This product is made well, feels great, and is VERY easy to use on multiple applications (even more than my Klein’s). The grip is rounded with two flat spots for additional torque, the shaft has small grooves toward the middle that allow you to use your opposing hand to twist quickly, and the hex head on the base of the shaft allows for a wrench or pliers to be applied if necessary. 
While there are obviously equivalents to this product on the market, very few are in this price point. And none of them are Milwaukee. This is a game changer compared to the cheaper models.

Also, the other units take a lot longer to get a tire up to recommended tire inflation. I love the fact that the Milwaukee has its own battery and will “top off” several tires before it needs a charge. This is not as good as a garage air compressor.

I was wrong. It's hilariously powerful for it's size! It's a bit power hungry when cutting through hardwood 4x4 pallets but it didn't slow down whatsoever! A 4.0ah battery will do the trick for light stuff, but 6.0 without question if you're going to work it. That being said, I would much rather have to swap batteries on an amusingly impressive compact tool than have an average tool with average everything.

5/18/2019,2623-20,"M18™ 3-1/4"" Planer (Tool Only)","I purchased my planer as part of a large kit and of all my stuff this is the absolute worst tool. I do high end carpentry and so I use my tools frequently but not as heavily as general domestic carpenters. I have returned 3 planes and had them replaced under warranty with the same issues. My current fourth one I haven't touched other than to check the base for alignment and find that it too is misaligned from the factory.
The one critical 'feature' that all planers need is a solid and well aligned front and rear shoe and this is exactly what these planers lack. Features like the left and right chip ejection and the rear stand which can be retracted would be nice but are rendered useless if the planer doesn't work.
Planer number 1; used it for less than a week before the front shoe became horribly misaligned and unuseable.
Planer number 2; checked the base out of the box and found it was out of alignment. Attempted to make a pass and found cut out of square and snipe occuring badly. Also cut depth not matching the scale on the depth adjustment knob by 2 mm.
Planer number 3; checked the base on opening the box, found it to be misaligned (in a different way to the last one). Back in the box without using and returned.
Planer number 4; checked it out of the box and found it was misaligned and also the rear shoe was warped! Meaning it can't even really be calibrated.
I'll return this one too but for now it's just sitting in a box. I am sick of driving back to the tool shop to be handed another dud and disgusted that these have not been recalled.
I have used several brands of planer over the years and they have all worked better than this. I have only had to calibrate them after quite extensive trade use.

Overall it a great tool, lots of power, compact etc.  However of the two I purchased one had a severely wobbly chucks that was so bad that any hole drilled ended up being oversize.  It's hard to believe the one drill motor made it through Milwaukee's quality controls and checks before packaging and delivery to any customer.   Then when contacting Milwaukee I got the run around from their customer support one the phone who said I should take it to a local Milwaukee store for exchange.  Then drove 30+ miles to the Milwaukee store in Seattle only to find that since I did not purchased the drill in their store, they would not provide an exchange drill motor for such a poorly made wobbly chuck and basically said sorry they could not help me and that I should contact Milwaukee directly.   I finally went to a local store that's known for great customer service and explained the problem and they took care of providing a brand new exchange unit and said they would send the defective drill motor back to Milwaukee.   So, to thumbs up for my local small hardware strore and two thumbs down for Milwaukees product support and run around for defective products. But overall, I still recommend Milwaukee tools and this is the only issue I've had with the various Milwaukee tools I own (M18 and M12).  
I'd give the first drill motor a 5 star!
I'd give the second drill motor a 1 star.

That said, I really like the one I purchased a year ago. As a homeowner it's perfect for use when painting rooms or working on a sump pump. The three light levels are just right to brightly light a room or dim it down for normal work. When not used for work this one sits in the ""man cave"" and makes a great floor lamp.

5/23/2019,2722-21HD,M18 FUEL™ SUPER SAWZALL® Kit,"Seriously, this tool eliminates my repetitve-stress injury.  My muscle recovery time after a couple hours' work is maybe 10-20 minutes and feels like good exercise, compared to the same work with a lighter saw - which takes 3 times longer and rattles my arms, wrists and elbows to the point I'd feel the inflammation for weeks.

This tool is heavy to heft but uses that weight to its advantage. Cutting downward or vertically, the tool's weight does much of the work for me. But you can find several excellent video reviews of typical indoor and demo cutting; I'll focus on yardwork for this review.

My blades - even long ones - stay straighter longer than with a lighter saw, as there is minimal body shake. The straight-cut vs orbital-cut switch, on straight cut, steadies the blade even further. I've been cutting roots in dirt to take out bushes and to dig post-holes - a notoriously abusive job that in a lighter saw bends 6"" blades in seconds - and using a 9"" 5TPI wood blade I've done 100 feet of cuts and the blade is still straight.

Cutting down large vertical branches and small tree trunks with a pruning blade is easy with this saw. Working the saw sideways my first impression was the saw's weight gave my forearms a bit of a workout, but the work was noticeably smooth and the resulting cuts are so clean I rarely need to follow with a finish cut. 

The larger battery that comes in this kit has far more runtime than I've used in a day. I've got maybe 3 hours' runtime on it over the last several weeks, recharged once and it did not need it. The point of going with this kit with its larger battery was more power: in this tool, bigger battery = both more power and longer run time.",5

This unit has ample power for even thick brush. Obviously, there are more specialized tools. I'm not saying this does absolutely everything. BUT this WILL handle the occasional 2 foot tall grass if you moderate your speed. It's got tons of power.

Battery life is great for maintenance tasks. I can get through a dozen accounts in a day on two HD9.0 batteries working efficiently.

It's very light, and so easy to start and use. You pick it up, pull the trigger and go. You realize you forgot a patch after driving off? Don't start it up again! Just grab n' go. Super convenient.

No maintenance.

Make sure you use the High Demand or High-Output system if you plan to do heavy cutting with this trimmer, otherwise the battery or tool may have a tendancy to overheat and temporarily shut down. This is especially true in hot weather. For light cutting, no problem - but keep this in mind.

All in all, I'd never buy a gas trimmer again other than for more specialized tasks, like trimming in ditches were bicycle handlebars are better suited to the task. 5 stars. 

Suggestions:

Add an option for bicycle bars. Easy $100 from me.
Dual-battery option for extended runtime would be nice. 
Better guard (Quik-Lok improved on this, but needs full coverage unless increases load on the motor).

I’ve had years when they were significantly effected by overspray I’m assuming from a farmer or maybe a neighbor as I live in a small rural community. LOVE that it runs on M18 batteries that I didn’t even have to go purchase - no hooking it up to your lawnmower or ATV battery with long flimsy wires and clamps. Anyhow, I’ve used it 3-4 times. Pretty straight forward. Good design. Easy to clean. 4 stars because I think Milwaukee can take this 1 step farther for the serious pro grower or pest control operator and make a tank with built in agitator for wettable powders. I used 1 TBS sodium bicarbonate per gallon and ALMOST clogged it up. I’m assuming I won’t even be able to run Surround WP or even consider buying other powders.",4

Sure the blade left saws are here, but my 2730 as much as i love it, i don't like the dust cropping i end up with so use it for specialty cuts that it does good at.
But plowing through boards with this 2732 w the 12.0 on it is just a blast. I made my first cut yesterday and thought no way..........No battery powered saw can cut like this, but it does. Smooth running machine and very easy to control. The weight has also been talked about, and again, it's a power saw not a toy.

I would have to make multiple attempts while rotating pipe before it would make it all the through. Faster to just grab a hand saw. Another thing is I never saw it cut a truly square cut on anything. Especially the small stuff. If your plumbing anything other then residential DWV I’d look somewhere else. One other thing, it does not like any moisture at all. Used it cutting into existing lines and even cleaned it afterward. The next day it was rusted solid. Had to tear completely apart and clean. Just not a very heavy duty tool. Very disappointing.

I use this for my 2730 6 1/2"" saw and it's a match made in heaven. Gives the saw good balance, and a noticeable power boost over the standard batteries. It charges with the standard charger just fine, but the rapid charger is the best choice if you have one. So far i have cut 12 sheets of 5/8"" ply in half, and split a dozen 2x8's and the battery still shows 4 bars. That's just amazing.
Weighs about 12 ounces more than the XC 5.0 so it's great to use on anything really. I also tried it on my 2732 Cir saw and there is very little difference in the saws performance vs using the 12.0.

Waiting to hear back from Milwaukee on replacements...our authorized service center sent them in for repair. I'm extremely disappointed as I love the concept of these sprayers and have never had issues with the other Milwaukee tools we have purchased. I own a landscape company and need these sprayers RIGHT NOW, not when someone gets around to authorizing a repair or replacement. These are brand new products...any manufacturing defect should result in immediate replacement.",1

6/11/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I have had all kinds and brands of weed eaters. For the best  power you have to go for gas until now. I was amazed at how torquey this fuel m18 was. Besides the power you don't get the number hands like the gas ones also it is lighter than my Toro. I need a strap to hold it up the gas ones  and this one there is no need. Now one reason I bought Milwaukee was it takes the standard batteries I used my 9.0ah bat on the low setting and found I didn't need to go for the higher speed it gave me 26min of 3foot grass being cut and I was amazed how much I got done in that short amount of time. So I think they have made a perfect  balance between power and weight that I can't see anyone topping in the near future.,5

Worse than the cheap Chinese made Harbor freight cutter my apprentice uses.  If the copper is slightly out of round be ready for frustration as it comes off the pipe again and again.  If you don't tighten it extremely tight to start your cut it will thread itself down the tubing instead of forming a single groove.  I hate this tool and wish I'd have just bought another Ridgid.

Luckly they are all lifetime warranty. Ive bought 1 and been through around 3, just got my 4th. I just take it back too where i bought it, and grab another one. But i like the feel and design compared to other brands... (i was a Stanley guy forever, until my boss turned me on to one) And the the tape does stand out pretty far..9 or 10 feet, 11 is pushing it lol it normally kinks on me before. I like the magnet, it can be handy,  it can also get in the way its so strong it will stick to objects you dont intend to.

I lost an inch I draw depth but gained two inches in width. The added top draws and space in the area under the lid was a no brainer. I use this box in a shop as an EVT (emergency vehicle technician) it fits everything in need and I have extra space now. 
Guys in my shop are very impressed with it as am I. You can’t beat the price for this quality. With every penny. 
I would like to note;

I do wish that the head guard was either a little bit wider, or adjustable around the head so that it would block more debris from flying back at the operator. This is the only trimmer I have ever used where the head spins counterclockwise. I usually work in such a manner that the cutting head throws the cut debris away from me and now I have to trim everything in a different pattern or the debris gets thrown directly back at me past the guard. The trimmer itself is definitely amazing though!",5

After several ounces of LPS Prosolve and a lot of scratching with my finger nails the stickers are finally gone.  

The box is great and the soft close drawers work better once loaded.  After emptying my old box I still have a lot of room for more tools!

6/28/2019,2733-20,M18 FUEL™ 7-1/4” Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw (Tool Only),"This is an awesome Saw!  It not only looks great and it functions flawlessly out of the box.

The build quality is top notch.  Milwaukee has used quality materials in it’s construction, e.g. aluminum, stainless steel, polymers, rubber, etc.

I was looking for a good deal prior to purchasing and I found it at CPO Milwaukee.  I ended up going with a refurbished “tool only” option for $299.00.  It was delivered in about a week in a big white box.  When I opened the first layer of foam included a clamp, dust bag, charger and 5 amp battery.  Yes!  CPO sent me the kit version in lieu of tool only!!  When I got down to the Saw itself, they had sent me a brand new Miter Saw.  It still had the packing foam and factory zip tie holding the head down.  Thank CPO Milwaukee!!

I love the soft start, 5,000 rpms of brushless power and the electric brake, which stops the blade almost instantaneously.  It goes through 2x wood like a hot knife through butter.

I put a Diablo aluminum cutting blade on it, in order to cut through led extruded aluminum channels.  It produces a super clean cut.

The only thing that’s missing from this saw, which would make it in my opinion almost perfect, is a “depth stop”.  I’m not sure why Milwaukee decided not to include this feature, as this saw came out after the 10”, which includes it.  There looks to be an area near where this feature could be incorporated that’s tapped for a screw.  I’m wondering if Milwaukee engineers could come up with an add on kit for this.  I’ll include a picture where this feature might possibly be added.

For a very nice Miter Saw, you can’t go wrong with this saw!!",5

So after that experience, and already knowing I wanted to stick with battery power, researched and selected this Milwaukee string trimmer and it has been an excellent replacement to this point.  While expensive, it helped that Milwaukee has a deal right now where you can get the trimmer with the weed eater attachment and another tool -- in my case, the pole saw was a terrific addition.

In action, this is a heavy duty trimmer; blowing through thick, tall grass and even woody stemmed plants.  I trim about 2/3rds of an acre and don't even use one bar of the new 12Ah battery and the trimmer barely breaks a sweat -- hoping that performance metric continues!  Charge times for the battery don't seem overly long, though I haven't recharged it from dead yet.  Haven't used the string trimmer attachment yet, but already know it's going to make my life easier come Fall when I have a number of trees to clean up.

I set up one key when I first got it then put the impact in the toolbox to keep as a backup for my existing M18 Surge Impact (which I use daily and love). About 5 months later I went to use this impact on a project so I wouldn't have to keep switching bits in my surge... This impact doesn't work now. As soon as I put a battery on (any battery, I tried 6 different M18 batteries) a different combination of lights stay on continuously on the impact level selector and will not allow me to change levels; sometimes even the light above the trigger won't shut off!  Pulling the trigger results in SUPER slow bit rotation with almost no torque. Must be some circuit board failure... Comforting since I literally have never used this tool. If I quickly remove and reinstall a battery, usually 2 of the level lights come on at the same time and sometimes all 4 and rarely only one lights! I also Can't connect to One-key either. I own 20 different M18 tools (4 of those are one-key) along with 14 different M12 tools and this is the second M18 Fuel One-key that has basically completely failed with pretty much no use and the other M18 Fuel OneKey (my drill) has ongoing intermittent issues. Starting to question my abondoning team yellow in favor of what seemed to be a superior tool company because I never had a yellow tool fail that wasn't ridden hard and put away wet... Yet here I am with 10% of my M18 Fuel tools that have failed or have issues with basically zero use... Not a good sign. I will say that the ones I use every day have been MOSTLY flawless. The exception is my M18 Fuel drill (also one-key) which has a funky trigger issue where sometimes it doesn't work and you have to fully release it then re-pull the trigger and it will work fine for most of the day after that but I am getting concerned about reliability of all the One Key tools as the drill has done this trigger game from day one and it does seem to be a little worse now. Going to take this impact and my drill in for warranty service and see how they are afterwards but for now I am going to seriously question any more M18 Fuel purchases (definitely no more one-key stuff) and can't justify my usual impulse buys anymore if I can't have faith that the tools will work when I grab them out of the tool box... 10% is just too high of a failure rate even for heavily used tools... It is a RIDICULOUS failure rate for backup tools that are rarely used!  I REALLY want to love all the Milwaukee tools but I will need my shaken confidence restored before I spend any more hard earned bucks on the Fuel stuff... At least the One-Key stuff anyway since ALL 3 of the tools I am having or have had an issue with are One-Key tools!!! Hopefully my high dollar OneKey site light works when I need it because that light can make or break a job when I fall behind and need to work late. May need to find a non-one-key version just to keep as a backup.  Bottom line... BOOOOO for One-Key... Change my mind Milwaukee! So far your ""innovation"" with One key has let me down big time.",1

7/4/2019,2707-22,"M18 FUEL™ HOLE HAWG® 1/2"" Right Angle Drill Kit","Construction plumber for over 30 years. That whole time I’ve used a corded old style Hole Hawg with selfeed bits for making holes in wood. The drill is a beast but it fights the user as much as the wood, between its weight, and providing counter-rotational force. And this is magnified after catching a couple nails (and you do.)

Recently bought the M18 Hole Hawg and 9.0 batteries to use with Big Hawg bits. I have a wide variety of FUEL tools and they are very convenient but I wouldn’t say anything was “revolutionary” in its function. Until now. The effortlessness required to make holes with this combo (and I don’t say this hyperbolically,) is mind blowing. And the little extra time to remove the plug (if it doesn’t fall out on its own) is a price gladly paid. 
I don’t care for the raised handle, and it was removed before the first hole was drilled. That saves space in tight fits, and I prefer a hand-on-the-tool connection. The weight, speed, and power in relation to the cutting surfaces of Big Hawg bits is optimal. When the tool does bind, power is automatically cut to the motor. 

One thing the drill lacks, and one thing the bits lack:
Why doesn’t the drill have a rafter hook? It’s good enough for a circular saw and Sawzall, and this tool cries out for one as much if not more than the others. There’s no excuse why this is lacking.
The Big Hawg arbor is marketed as “quick change” but it isn’t, nor is anything else requiring a tool. Why hasn’t Milwaukee added its seemingly solid-built, real quick change 7/16” arbor (49-56-7240) to the Big Hawg line?

That said, more than any other Milwaukee tool I’ve ever used (and their pipe cutters come a distant second,) I want to thank the engineers who designed the M18 “Hawg” system.",5

As far as performance goes I'd say it cuts every bit as fast or faster then a gas one and is much quieter.

7/13/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","We are small farm owners on Vancouver Island and have both clearing jobs as well as ~50% of our household heating comes from wood.  I've had a Husqvarna gas saw (same one) for over 40 years since the days we lived in Prince George and had to cut 10 cords of birch a year to heat our house.  I was a bit apprehensive about the power and duration of a charge.  Both are impressive although, seriously, whereas you can just keep pouring gas into a gas unit and it should (might) run all day, the batteries do require charging, fast though that is.  Realistically, you'd likely need 3, if not 4, 12Ah batteries to allow ""continual cutting.  Now in my early 60s, I can't cut continuously so why would I need a saw that does so?  The big plus is the instant starting.  Gas always (always) gave me pause: did I want to go and potentially have a brief struggle with my saw to get it going or ... not today?  This saw simply runs.  Depress button, pull trigger, cut.  And I'm no longer running the risk of pulling my shoulder out of its socket by trying to start (or restart, repeatedly) my gas saw.  The other benefit is the quiet between cuts - no more endless rattle of the saw while you reposition yourself or move a block of wood.  It's very nice and quite unanticipated.  All these benefits and I'm sacrificing nothing.  Perhaps not so ""macho"" but I'm beyond having to prove anything.  And with pickup trucks able to handle 120v chargers, charging in the field and cutting continuously by cycling through batteries becomes a distinct possibility.  Very well-built and the operation is just so intuitive and trouble-free - it's one purchase I've made with absolutely no second-guessing.

My previous Milwaukee trimmer had the old style head on it and it performed flawlessly up until I sold it to make room for this model in my garage. I ordered this from HD and started using it last month. Has less than 2, 12ah batteries of runtime on it and it has started drawing the line on one side back in if gets below 3 inches out. had over 10 ft of original line in it when this started. Rewound and rewound then switched to my .095"" line which worked great in the previous model. Same exact issues, even with constantly stopping to check the line. Just about when you think you can go a minute instead of 30 seconds it bites you and you have to pull it apart and rewind it AGAIN. I really need a solution here.

7/14/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit",I have cut 8 cords of firewood with this saw. No drinking exhaust do not have to restart the engine each time I put it down to do other things.  It is not inexpensive but it is worth the price.,5
7/14/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","This chainsaw was purchased for around the house chainsaw needs.  We have big Husqvarna and Stihl gas saws used everyday in the logging woods but I just wanted a small saw to use on small jobs, mainly landscaping type work.  I couldn't be happier with this saw. 

With the 12AH battery I get about 1 hour of runtime.  That works out to about a tank of bar and chain oil.  The performance is much better than I expected or even hoped for.  It's comparable to a small gas saw.  Maybe better in some applications.  The chain doesn't travel as fast as a gas saw but it has a ton of torque that small gas saws don't have.  It's a good tradeoff to me and makes the saw much more controllable.  The small gas saws are designed for chain speed to make cuts.  The potential for kickback is increased with chain speed, making a small gas saw more dangerous than a big gas saw to me.  Small saws are more dangerous than big saws to me for that reason.  

The chain that comes with the saw is square top which also reduces kickback.  It doesn't cut as fast as round top, but it's the right chain for one of these saws.  I am not going to change to another chain design.  It takes a 5/32"" file to sharpen, which is the same size as my pole saw, but different from every other chainsaw I have.  

The scrench is well designed and I like that there is storage on the saw for it.  It is very securely held in place.  Almost too secure.  It's a pain to get out but I imagine will get easier over time and use.  The chain tension adjustment is steel, not plastic like most electric or battery saws.  If Milwaukee had used plastic here I would have been really disappointed.  But they didn't so I'm happy.  

Ergonomically the saw is pretty good.  It's a bit longer than a standard little gas saw.  The reason being you have to have room for that giant 12.0 battery.  The controls are well positioned and don't fatigue your hands as bad as some small saws.  The gigs also are very useful, and made of steel.  Some saws are unbelievably made from plastic.  Gross.  That is not a good place for plastic.  Well done Milwaukee.  

The 12.0 battery makes this saw what it is.  Yes, you can use the 9.0 batteries and it does pretty well with them.  But the 12.0 gives this saw turbo mode.  It is night and day difference over my 9.0HD batteries.  A 4.0XC battery will run the saw but with a noted loss in performance and runtime.  It can't be good for the smaller batteries to get completely sucked dry in 10 minutes either.  They are warm to the touch at the end.  I'll leave them on my drills and impacts, and only use the 12.0 and 9.0 batteries on this saw.",5

I took the charged battery off the charger and put it onto my drill. It worked for a couple of minutes, then stopped.  When the other battery was charged (light on charger was green) I did the same and the same thing happened!.  Maybe it's the charger, but It is also not very old, and it has seen no adverse conditions.

7/14/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","I purchased the Chainsaw at Christmas time and a few months later used it to cut down a dead Ponderosa pine in my front yard.  The tree was about 30-40 feet tall and just a bit over 16"" in diameter at the base.  I cut the tree down, limbed it, and then cut it into fireplace size logs on one battery.  This really amazed me!  It was cold out around freezing.  The saw worked great.  After that I used it to cut and remove a lot of Sage and Bitterbrush, also when cold out.  Because that work required cutting near the ground a lot I sharpened the chain a few times.  I do  this by hand with files and a guide.  I used Husqvarna file guides as Milwaukee doesn't ofter these for sale.  Same work as the bigger ones.  No issues.  The saw seems to oil its chain well and is able to stop oiling when its off.  I had a little leakage in storage but nothing like my gas saw. 
The saw is quiet compared to gas and I like that.  The thin kerf chain seems a bit more fragile than the older thicker one on my gas saw.  Its not bad but it requires attention to the tension more often.  I really felt like I was taking a risk on such an expensive battery powered device and I was surprised by how well it performed.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.  I'm hoping that a lower price solution for batteries appears in the future.",4

7/14/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","Milwaukee M18 FUELTM 16"" Chainsaw
I purchased this saw in November of 2018, it didn’t get much use that winter because I already had my firewood in for the year. I’ve been cutting/ falling trees for 30+ years, I burn aprox. 8 cords of wood per year. I already had a 16”, 18” and 24” saws of various CC’s and didn’t really need another saw, but I was curious to try one of these electric ones. One of the main motivators in purchasing this saw, was because they had a promo on, and I got a free 9 amp battery to go with the 12A battery the saw came with.
I live off the grid, and am fortunate to be able to start fetching firewood only minutes from my door. My preferred method of getting firewood is with my quad and trailer, the trailer holds just a tad over 1/2 a cord. I was hoping that with the 12A and 9A battery, that would be able to get me through a full load, unfortunately that was not the case. I may order another 12A battery, as I feel that with two of those batteries, that would be enough. I already have some corded Milwaukee tools, and plan on buying some of their cordless ones, so an extra battery or two wouldn’t hurt.
I couldn’t be bothered to try and count how many cuts I actually made, it didn’t really matter to me, I just wanted to be able to fill a trailer load. I have also been packing this saw with me on the quad when I go out riding, we have many beetle kill pine trees in my area, and they are forever falling in the trails. There has been more than a few times that I have run the 12A battery out cutting trail, and was thankful for the extra battery. Unlike a gas saw, once your battery is dead, there’s no refilling it on the go. It would be really inconvenient to get down a tight trail, turn around with a dead saw, and find a tree or two has fallen on the trail since you passed! This is not an exaggeration in a forest full of beetle kill trees, once the bases start to rot, they just fall over.
I pack a chainsaw on my snowmobile in winter as well, and was tempted to pack this electric saw, but that might have turned out to be an expensive experiment, as I wasn’t sure how well the electronics were sealed against snow dust. Maybe I’ll see if Milwaukee wants me to do some extra testing for them, it would also be interesting to see how the battery holds up in cold weather as well.

 Ok, lets move on to how this thing actually works. Every time I pull the trigger on this saw, I am surprised at how well it cuts! It has a pretty skinny chain on it that needs touching up after a load of wood, the sharper it is the better it cuts, and the more wood per charge you will get. The saw is fairly light, compares to a similar size gas saw. It cuts as well as a gas saw in the 14 to 16” bar length, around 36 to 42 cc. It handles 4” to 12” beetle kill pine with no issues, even a couple that buried the 16” bar, you just have to take it slow. Carry a spare chain with you as well, if you nick a rock or catch some dirt, these small chains get dull quick. As a side note: Beetle kill pine has a super fine dust that is known for plugging up filters and carbs in unusually short order. My big gas saw has needed two carb kits in the last 4 years, previously it had been over 10 years since the last one. I figured that an electric saw shouldn’t have an issue with the fine dust, I’ll know more in a couple of years.
The saw is well enough balanced, it handles limbing well, feels comfortable in the hand, doesn’t vibrate too much, and is very quit. The lack of noise and no smell of premixed fuel burning is a real plus. You don’t have to dig up some hearing protection just to make a couple of quick cuts. And you don’t have to deal with a cantankerous gas saw that’s been sitting for a few months, and doesn’t want to start easily. I can’t tell you how nice it is to just grab the saw, press the release button with your thumb and pull the trigger, it’s instant. My neighbour that I ride with has one of those cantankerous old saws, I can’t tell you how many times he is fighting with his saw, yanking away on the cord, I get tired of waiting for him, and just pull the trigger on mine. No muss no fuss, no choking, no pulling till your blue in the face. Or changing out a spark plug in a cloud of mosquito’s, that’s always fun.
Gas saws are designed so that by the time you burn through a tank of fuel, you “should” still have some chain oil left, thus preventing any excess wear on your chain and bar. I still haven’t quit figured out whether this is the case with this electric one, I am so used to a gas saw, that I am finding it hard to remember to check the bar oil. I have noticed that if the saw starts chattering a bit, especially doing an undercut, it’s usually low on oil. This saw also leaks very little chain oil, if any, not all saws are like this. And what compounds this chain oil timing issue more is, the 12A battery lasts longer than the 9A, I may have to contact tech support for that answer. I will say

 that I don’t miss carting along an extra couple of gallons of fuel and bar oil on my front rack, now I just take along a quart of oil. And a spare battery of course. :)
I have found that because I am so used to having a screaming gas saw in my hands, and wearing my hearing protection, that every time I use this electric one, it seems more “toy” like, for lack of a better description. It isn’t of course, this thing will cut you just as quick as a gas one, but because of the abundant amount of plastic and the lack of noise, it’s just different. Maybe it’s the noise factor, the wife even wants to learn how to use this saw, she has never shown interest in the gas ones? Overall, I like this saw, I really like the low noise, I like not having to mix, use/pay for gas, and a 16” saw is capable of most things I would cut. It will never compare to my H***y 61 with a 24” bar for cutting big wood, but it also weighs half as much, and my old back really appreciates that. I also like that I can put this saw into a tub in the back of the SUV, and cart it along when I’m out doing a little exploring, and not have my car stink like fuel for days after.
I really hope that as this battery technology advances, Milwaukee will figure out a way to get more cutting time out of a battery. Or maybe squeeze a bigger battery into it. If you plan on using this saw for fetching any amount of firewood, you need a minimum of 2 of the 12A batteries, in my opinion. If you already have some other Milwaukee cordless tools, then maybe you have enough batteries on hand. Otherwise, to buy the saw and 2 of the 12A batteries gets pretty expensive for a chainsaw. You can buy a pretty nice gas saw for less, but then you also have to deal with the noise and associated fuel, carb, spark plug issues. It all boils down to what you want to use it for and whether you already have other Milwaukee tools and batteries. If your going into the firewood cutting business, then this saw isn’t going to cut it, no pun intended. More and more I find myself grabbing this electric saw, as compared to my gas ones, for the things I like about it.

7/19/2019,48-22-8541,46 in 8 Drawer Top Chest,"The chest (only part I purchased) seems to be built well. I purchased for non-movable storage. The box was in great condition when unpacked. I found when I first opened it that the drawers would only come out half way. After removing drawers and inspection, found the linkage for the lock to the drawers is really poorly constructed. After attempting to adjust the rods and lock, I relinquished myself to the fact that this was as good as it was going to get. I have to reach in the box and bend the rods to get the drawers to open all the way each time I unlock the chest. I have spent thousands of dollars with Milwaukee Tools and this is the first time I have felt let down with a product of theirs. My only advice, don't purchase until you are satisfied that the box is working to your satisfaction. I highly recommend Milwaukee tools, but if this is the box you are buying to store expensive tools in, would go for a Snap-on or Matco, they have a reliable locking system.",2

As I find the M12 series has fantastic torque among the whole family of tools, this ratchet is controllable at 250 RPM and super light/wieldable. I absolutely love how compact it is as I use it regularly for small engine repair, automotive jobs, and general fastening. It's battery life is superb with the 1.5A batteries with not much need for using the more bulky XC batteries when it tight spaces.

10/10 would recommend for any one looking to expand their M12 collection that needs a compact and controllable ratchet.",5

Absolutely love how lightweight and compact it is, and you can tell Milwaukee made their M12 line to last.

Using the XC 3.0 or 4.0 batteries, this drill has impressive battery life span. An absolutely wicked drill for the size and money and should be considered by any DIY'er or professional looking for a compact handy little drill. 

Also, did I mention the torque? Because its go LOTS of it.",5

This driver has LOADS of torque for its size and has been fantastic on battery life. I've used this driver for hanging OSB throughout my garage to hang shelving and when paired with a XC 3.0 or 4.0 battery, its a monster. 

If you're looking for a compact driver that performs with loads of torque, look no further.",5

I've used it doing lots of yard work and trimming, as well as cutting through 2x2s and other wood during demolition work. Beware, this thing needs a larger battery pack so ensure you have a XC 3.0 or 4.0 battery to pair with it. 

If you need more power, upgrade to the FUEL HACKZALL.",5

With the M18 9amp battery the blower has a nice balance to the unit. Milwaukee boasts about the two speeds the blower has, what they down play in my opinion is the best part. This blower has a small DC drive in it. You can vary the speed with trigger pressure. So, if you have a pile of wood chips or leaves, slight pressure you can make a nice pile without blowing it all over. Or pull the trigger all the way for one of the TWO MAX SPEED settings. Fine little work in the rose bushes, no problem. Nedd to clean out gutters or move a pile across the yard, no problem. At full max speed the 9.0 battery lasts about an hour. Low speed I've gotten to 1.5 hours.",5

I may take it in to have it looked at. In the mean time, I only charge on a steel table to concrete just to make sure. All in all, I really like it, however, I still feel it was too expensive.",4

The weeds and grass were thick and the trimmer ate it up. The only problem I had was the string getting stuck inside the spool. It was factory wound and it jammed up inside. It took me several attempts at fixing it before I figured out the problem. The instructions just say to stick the string through equally and wind it up. They left out holding tension on the string as you wind it up. If you don't the string will bind up inside and not feed.

7/20/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I used this unit once for 2.5 hours. I did change the battery half way thru but the original line is still on the unit. It's nice to have no fuel or cords. Please the other Milwaukee tools share the same batteries.,5

She suffered with a weak (both battery power & velocity) Worx blower. I’m a Milwaukee guy & have several M12 & M18 tools. So a Milwaukee blower was a given. Absolutely love it! We’ll balanced, long lasting even with a 5.0 battery.",5
7/20/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"This is a powerful blower.   A fully charged 5.0 battery will last about 20 to 30 minutes on high.

I gave it 4 out of 5 because it keeps sucking my shirt into the blower(just an annoying aspect) and it would be nice if the blower had more of a directional nozzle.",4
7/20/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"One of my best buys!
Best on compost decking, never scratch your decking again. Bought two of them one for the lake and one at home. Well worth it!, use it on boat, riding lawnmower,truck box etc......",5

7/20/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit",I got this for random small jobs and its perfect for me. I have a echo gas with the same size bar and there comparable performance wise. I was scared of this at first because I have a Ryobi battery saw that's like 8 years old and I tried to use it once and never touched it again but the m18 performs like a saw should.. Every person I have shown it too has been pretty WOW'ed by it,5
7/20/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Powerful, convenient and long lasting when coupled with the 12.0 Ah battery. The bigger battery is a must if you use a blower for extended periods (+20 min.) It’s been perfect for blowing grass clippings and leaves even when wet.",5

7/20/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),This is just the right size for my one acre property. Usable at a moments notice (if the battery pack is charged).  No gas needed. No tugging at the line trying to get it started.  The only thing that might make it better would be a second battery for those times when there’s really a lot to do. I like this string trimmer. I think its well worth the money.,5
7/20/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit",Awesome chain saw. Plenty of power. It's great to not have to mix gas and oil like I had to for my old chain saw. It's also great to not have to wear hearing protection while using this tool. Milwaukee got it right with this one.,5

7/20/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"It’s great for home owner. Use it after mowing on driveway, sidewalks, flower beds and general clean up. I can use the trimmer and blower with 9.0 battery on my very large yard two plus times on one charge. Think if they offer two sizes of tubes, one smaller may give that little extra in the flower beds. I will be keeping my gas blower for fall use.",5

7/20/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I originally bought a Roybi blower because the price was cheaper than the Milwaukee.  After charging up the 12ah battery I used the leaf for some light duty leaf blowing and it only lasted me 9 minutes, not impressed!!  Returned the Ryobi and bought the Milwaukee blower, after charging the 6ah battery fully I was able to get 20 minutes out of it.  Well worth the extra money!!l",5
7/20/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I own a swimming pool service. I use my Fuel M18 blower to clear off the pool deck. I love the light weight and the power on high is adequate for what I’m doing. Mine came with a 9ah battery. It only last a total of 20 minutes on the high setting. I was Told it would last over an hour. That is disappointing. The other down side is it cost twice as much as a gas blower.,3

I may never use them again! I’ve cut down 18 inch diameter trees with this saw without blinking an eye. Nice to just be able to set the saw down and just pick it up and instantly go back to sawing. Super quiet! No fuel mixing. No fumes. I’ve even used it indoors in my shop! I’ve yet to stall this beast! I have a 12 amp battery for it, I always give out before it does. Get one!!

7/20/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit",This saw is fantastic. The first time I used it my neighbor who was standing by me didn't know that I was cutting. Another neighbors tree had fallen across his fence and driveway and I was helping him clear the drive and he was ready for me to go get my topping saw but I had this. The only drawback is they don't sell a millwakee replacement chain that I have been able to find.,5
7/20/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),A very well built trimmer. Expensive but worth it. No regrets.,5
7/20/2019,49-16-2721,M18 FUEL™ QUIK-LOK™ 3' Attachment Extension,I use this extension with my FUEL string trimmer attachment  and it works great trimming under bushes not wanting to deflower them is a skill I have perfected. Although it is not stated this attachment works with the string trimmer ( only states compatable with hedgetrimmer and pole saw) you can use with your string trimmer. Definitely recommend the shoulder strap for extra support and balance.,5

I love that there is no gas smell, choke, and ""on-demand"" readiness.  For it's size, it cut quickly and smoothly through some oak and cherry wood.  I wish it had a bigger bar and chain so I could put it through some bigger wood.  The chain also went a bit dull after about 4 battery uses.",4
7/20/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),The performance exceeds gas trimmers.  Battery has enough to get my 50’ x 200’ yard done and then use the remaining battery on my leaf blower.,5
7/20/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I love the fuel blowers. I have one version at work and a different one at home. Not sure exactly what the between the two are but they both work great.the only complaint I have is the one I have at home doesn’t stand up very well by itself.,5

This machine is light enough yet powerful enough to get the job done. For use in a commercial lawn maintenance setting, one would need 4 batteries of more for the day. I have yet to try this blower in the fall when the leaves are plentiful. 
I like this blower.",4
7/20/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I use the Milwaukee string trimmer to mow my entire yard. It has been worth more than the price tag from the first time I used it. Only issue so far is the quick-lock attachment on the motor side slips loose occasionally,4
7/20/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I've never used an electric string trimmer before purchasing this tool, but I will never go back. The motor spins up very quickly and has enough power to tackle any weeds I've come across so far. I have a 1,400 sqft lot with fences, detached garage, and plenty to trim up. It only takes a single battery to finish everything. The unit itself does not get hot like gas powered engines and is maintenance free. Have not changed the spool yet, but appears to be a typical spool release mechanism.",5

I do a lot of trimming and clearing of juvenile and smaller trees on 9 acres outside Austin, TX. The transition speed difference between cutting and positioning for the next cut literally doubles the amount of work I can get done in an hour with this thing over my gas Echo, which was GREAT. It’s quiet too, so I can start an hour earlier without guilt about disturbing the woods. It’s lighter than the gas machine so I can work longer, but I still can’t go as long as the battery with any of the M18 machines I have. Unreal power and performance from a little battery. Didn’t think it was possible. Amazing.",5
7/20/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I love this string trimmer.  It is always ready to go in an instant.  No messing around with gasoline and stubborn carburetors.  It has more than enough battery to do all the trimming I need to do after mowing my 2 acres here at the farmstead.  And, it seems to me that the nylon string that came with the trimmer holds up better than what I had on my gas powered trimmer.  I would highly recommend this string trimmer.",5

I'll run it for roughly 20-25 minutes before hitting the last light on the 9ah battery, which in all fairness, is quite efficient. If you need more run time, get the 12ah battery, but it'll be a bit heavier. I use it mainly for blowing off cars after washing to get most of the water off, then a quick wipe. Perfect for that as well as clearing the deck of leaves and debris. Same top level quality as all of my Milwaukee tools.

We chose the fuel specifically for the Milwaukee reputation, the brushless technology and the whopper batteries.

This was about 8 months ago. I use this at least 5 days a week for at least a couple hours at a time. This impact has been going strong and has even out lasted a few of the fuels that have had to go back for service. It has surpassed the fuel in driving self-drilling screws and tapping large 1/4+ inch holes for bolts. 

I am more than pleased with this impact given the price. The only thing I have noticed is that it gets hotter than the fuel faster. It is also a bit larger, and not as smooth. I will be getting another fuel soon but this will always be a great backup.",4

I have used other chainsaws with higher voltage that do not perform as much as this. I like that it has two screws to hold the chain tight.

Long story short you can only use it with water-based sealers. This limits the use for us a lot since most of what we do is solvent-based.

7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Nice tool with a lot of power, and i like the fact that it has two speeds.   Only drawback is I wish it had an adapter for the end to make the discharge smaller.",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"So quick and convenient blows water, dust and anything off concrete for sealing. Also groves and places that are difficult to sweep or brush.",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),To just grab the blower stick in a battery and go is about as easy as it gets. It wont replace a big back pack blower or the need to blow a huge lawn but for most simple task it is so easy.,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Purchased for home owner use and it works great. I only have a .5 acre lot, but the backyard is fenced, so I trim a good amount. Grass is all I trim and run the trimmer on the slower range. 9 ah battery has not run down while trimming and will also run the blower. I hate the trimming part of mowing the lawn, however this trimmer makes me hate it less than the gas trimmer.",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"So far , this blower is totally wicked ! Everything from cleaning out my shop, blowing the grass clippings off the sidewalk, blowing the water off of your vehicles after washing. Can’t wait to see what it’ll do in the winter with a skiff of snow. I’ve got 2 driveways, so I’m sure it will make short work of those. The only thing I think it needs is a little hole in the base to hang it up on the wall. No big deal !",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),3amp battery (brand new) only lasts 15 minutes. That’s not enough time time finish one yard without needing a recharge,2
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Its great for its size, don't expect it to be a backpack blower as it is obviously not. It does like the larger batteries 5.0 and larger.",4
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),Works great.  Well balanced and very sharp blade.  Great buy.,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Great product. use to clean out gutters & roof. So good I owe 2 of them. I like the adjustable switch to keep it running at set speed with out pulling trigger and holding it.,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Lots of power, battery charges and last for a long time",4
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),Purchased this since some of the crew had trouble figuring out 2-cycle gas mix and burned up gas trimmers. This battery trimmer works great! The easy feed string feature is awesome! I also purchased additional 9ah and 12ah batteries. I would also recommend purchasing the high power M18 fuel blower.,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"At home trimming, dependable, long battery life, user friendly.",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I think the product is good works fine. it should come with a reduced tip to make it more concentrated .and also it should still come with a battery even if it’s a small one something is better than nothing.,4
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I never thought I would ever buy a ‘leaf blower’.

Three things put me over the line of justification:
1) I already own a lot of Milwaukee tools (M12 & M18), so I have the batteries and chargers.
2) the deal offered another 9.0 battery for free
3) my application is at the cottage, where I can be a few hundred feet at times from any power outlet, so cordless is more than just a convenience.

I am impressed with the power, to the point where you need to be conscious where you’re pointing it.....be careful what you ask for.
I use it for more than just pushing leaves around. If we get a light dusting of dry snow it cleans the steps and cars off way faster than brushing.
At the cottage we are in the middle of the woods. The walkways regularly need to be swept. This ‘leaf blower’  makes a great outdoor broom, especially for uneven pathways and stairways made up of flagstone and natural rock, with hundreds of edges and crevices.",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),This product has more power than my old corded one and there is no tripping hazard!,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"The trimmer is excellent, the only problem I have is the new one came out and it has all the attachments. I’m a little bummed that if I would have been told there was a new one coming out l, I would have waited! I still love Milwaukie tools, hands down the best.",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Works great for blowing out my garage from wood chips and dust. Also works good for drying the dog off when he goes out in the rain,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I use my blower a couple times a week and love it. It is plenty powerful, much quieter and lighter than my gas blower and super convenient. I hope one day they come up with a leafvac that grinds them into smaller debris- I would buy it in a heartbeat",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Only complaint is wish batteries lasted longer when in high setting. Awesome product!!,4
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"Has an impressively long bar, runs quiet and has sharp teeth. With the length comes a little extra weight but it’s manageable. Using a 5.0XC battery I used it for 30 minutes and it had 4 bars still. Has a nice bar cover for storage. Cut through a bush branch that was as big around as a no.2 pencil. Great buy! Just wish I had saw the QUIK-Lock tool first and i would have gotten that instead for the Change-ability",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I use it around my house. It’s dry in Nevada, I blow dry dust out of the garage, small dry leaves in the driveway and out of landscaping.",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),It is up to any task I ask it to do. I love that it is ready to go at any time no gas needed,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"No more fuel & oil mix is nice, 
The battery last about a hour, I have an acre plus size yard, I can almost finish trimming the yard off one battery, it would be nice if the unit came with 9.0ah batteries.
The weed guard needs to be a bit bigger, often small pieces of the thicker grass and small debris gets thrown up near your face.  I will probably add something for a bit bigger guard for protection, that is the only thing I do not like about the string trimmer.",4
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I have owned 2 of these Milwaukee blowers for more than 2 years and they are great!
 We originally bought 2 of the EGO -blowers from Home Depot and they did not last more than a couple of month and there warranty is a joke and no one interested repairing them. We ended up throwing the EGO blowers a way!",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),It is so convenient. To not have to hook up an extension cord any longer to maintain my property blow off my back deck and front porch.  And it has plenty of power,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Battery  Time is remarkable considering as long as you hold the trigger down and don’t let go you can get almost an hour out of it if you’re starting and stopping a lot you only get about 30 minutes I have two of these are use them commercially and have found them to be very very useful they work really well in my profession because they are so quiet and I’m able to do work even with a large number of people around doesn’t have the abilities that your regular full-size backpack blower has However it is perfect for clearing light leaves sidewalks and other daily chores,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Impressed does the job lightweight and compacted my only complaint is the suction likes to grab you loose clothes when in use.,4
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Has multiple uses other than just blowing leaves. Has enough power with the perfect amount of thrust to stay light and mobile.,4
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),This blower unreal !!  Wish the blower nozzle had attachments,4
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),Use this around are business won’t go back to gasoline motor after using Milwaukee electric. Only Thing that could make it better would be bigger badder batteries that could go even longer.,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I use it for my yard work and this thing is amazing. It has great power and runs for a long time on my high output HD12.0 battery. I always recommend Milwaukee products to everyone i know,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),This thing works amazing the 9 ah battery works roughly an hour like the description says powers through anything around the yard    and having the option to switch attachments  is awesome would definitely recomend to a friend,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Bought this to use at my Main St. office to clean off the breezeway and sidewalk. Does the job well. Because it has more power than I expected, I have no issues with battery life. With that said, haven’t used it at home for larger jobs. It’s super lightweight! Even if battery life isn’t enough, I’m planning to buy another one for home to replace a gas blower. Has at least as much useable power as my Ryobi 40v. I prefer the Milwaukee.",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Just used it once to trim around my fence.  About 40 mins using it mostly on low.  Initially I was worried my 5 ah red lithium batteries would not last long enough to get the job done as this tool normally comes with 9 ah.  Got the job done no problem in 1 charge with 20% to spare.  I am slowly switching to electric cordless tools.  No more mixing gas, old gas problems, or prepping for storage for me.  Expensive!  Should come with a longer warranty.  Only time will tell how long it lasts; 5 stars until then.",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I use it for sticks, leaves, grass clippings, helicopters and pine cones,  sawdust, ""sweeping"" my garage, drying my mower and grill,",5

Absolutely love it! Only thing I would do differently is by the quicklok option for the attachments!!",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I use this to blow off my large patio ...works great.,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),This does great for my yard and around my wood fence.,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),works great got rid of my gas one i wish it had a reductor on the blower end,5

7/27/2019,2108,300-Lumen LED Magnetic Flood Light,"After using this light a few times over a couple of weeks it went to shutting off a few seconds after turning it on. First time I’ve ever been disappointed over a Milwaukee tool. I see here in Reviews that others have had this problem too. I had purchased one for each of my son’s next birthdays and was about to take them back but thought of something - maybe this is the device’s way of telling me that the batteries are getting low. I put new batteries in and the thing is working like new. So at least for now, we still have a present for each of the boy’s upcoming birthday. Thanks Milwaukee for awesome tools!",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I have a lot and a half in town and I get 3 to 4 uses on one charge from a 5AHr Battery. It does a great job. Next item on my list is the weed trimmer!!!,5

Pro: Powerful! (Tried the Craftsman and Worx and returned both) relatively quiet.

After the first time using i had to have a second  one .It's  not fair  to call it a leaf blower it so much more.

7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),I use this tool to trim up light bushes and cut heavy hedge limbs around the house and it does this job very nicely.  One battery lasts long enough to trim the entire property and then transfer the same battery over to the blower to blow off the deck and walk way to finish the job.  After a while the hedge trimmer can get a little heavy but hey this tool has to have some solid parts in it to perform this well for that amount of time.,5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"I have a number of bushes, shrubs, and annual/perennial plants on our property that need trimming and maintenance throughout the years.  Buying the Milwaukee M18 Hedge Trimmer is an upgrade away from my Stihl 2-cycle gas machinery that I've had for a long time.  What a please it is to get away from the gas-oil mixing, pulling the starter cord, the fumes, and the noise.  I find trimming with my new M18 hedge trimmer very efficient in quality of cut and time it takes.  With the M18 9.0Ah battery I have plenty of long-lasting power to get the job done.  Thank you Milwaukee for developing quality dependable and long lasting products!",5

7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Great trimmer. I love the pressure sensitive trigger. Trimmer is surprisingly quiet. Make sure you have a bigger battery though. I tried it first with the 1.0 and it did not last long, but the 5.0 did both mine and my neighbours yards.",5

7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),This is our 2nd battery powered trimmer. This one is by far the best of the two it is a two speed trimmer with easy operation and weight  is a lot less than my other trimmer.,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),It is more powerful than I thought light weight and doesn't take up a lot of space looking forward to using it in the winter for snow! Milwaukee tools are above all others,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Light weight and easy to store because of the new two-piece design. Nice power for battery operated blower. The only thing I would say is that I wouldn’t buy it if you’re a landscaper and needed to use it day after day. Not enough power compared to gas operated.,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),Amazing has two powers slow and fast. Love it as I have all Milwaukee tools I can charge M18 batteries on existing charging stations. It felt very commercial which is a good thing. Huge improvement from the Ryobi which my Milwaukee M18 weed Trimmer replaced and is  ten times better.,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I mow 3 houses front and back every weekend. This trimmer is just as powerful as the gas engine one it replaced, and it is really quiet.

7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Excellent and powerful leaf blower for the price. It’s all a homeowner really needs to get the job done. The only issue is you have to use the high capacity batteries or it dies within few seconds. So make sure you have the bigger batteries,5

7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),Great trimmer lightweight and doesn’t vibrate your body like a gas powered machine,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I like how lite weight it is with less vibration. If you keep your yard well maintained meaning no heavy trimming to be done it’s a great trimmer. The line gets bound up in the trimmer head doing heavy trimming.,4
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),In fact I DID buy another! I took my new trimmer out to my girlfriend's house where she used it and kept it! she told me she threw out her dad's old gasoline trimmer and I could just go buy another one! advice: dont let your girlfriend borrow it! LOL!,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I use this trimmer for my residential yard. The 5.0 battery lasts for several sessions. My first impression was that it was a little heavier than I was expecting. I figured it would be lighter than my gas job... it's not. Throttle response is quick, plenty of torque for heavier cutting. Pretty quiet... the dog doesn't scamper off when I'm using it. He's actually pretty curious about it, likes the taste of it. No more messy fuel mixing or smelly exhaust. Hopefully it will last for several years. Won't know that for a while. So far so good though.",4

7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I have used a couple of other weed wackers, one large 2 cycle gas powered unit with a harness to help support the weight and also a small corded wacker. This battery powered unit out performs them both and is lighter and easier to use. Battery life is amazing. I have a 3Ah and 6Ah batteries and between them both I get about an hour of use. If I put the one on the charger when I switch to the other it is almost charged when the second battery runs down. I thought I might need a harness to support this one, but it is so light and well balanced that It was not needed. My yard looks good!",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Makes yard work tolerable, does a efficient job, works every time instead of wasting energy and time with gas units. And most importantly gets me out of the hot sun quick because the job is done",5

7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),It’s a good product but is power hungry. I only have 3.0 batteries so I can’t run blower longer than 5 minutes,3
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"While I still use my Stihl Gas Powered Blower for very large jobs, my new M18 sees more frequent use as it is fast, quieter, lighter and nearly as powerful. What the M18 Blower lacks is power it more than makes up for in convenience as compared to my Stihl .",5

7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I am a landscaper and have had a gas blower for years.  I have been looking at a Milwaukee  m18 blower for awhile.  A couple of weeks ago I was having a hard time getting my gas blower to start and I pulled the cord right out of it..   That was all the convincing I needed to buy it.

7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Having over an acre of yard to trim with many trees I’m totally impressed with this string trimmer. Not only does it save time not having to mix gas and oil, it’s instantly ready to go . I love that part the most! I can trim my whole yard in about 1/2-3/4 of an hour. I have both 4 amp and 1.5 amp hour batteries and it usually takes one of each to finish the job. I bet I could easily do the whole job with one of Milwaukee’s new 9 amp hour batteries. I own a good number of Milwaukee m18 and m12 tools and use them daily in my trade. They are definitely built tough and last long.",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"It’s lightweight and easy to handle, only downside is the need for a 9.0+ battery or you get 15 min of time.",5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"No cord
Lightweight but tough
Extremely sharp
A lot quieter than my old corded model",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Use this around the home. It replaces a gas Stihl blower and a corded Stihl blower.  So much more convenient.,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"They are light and smooth, and there is nothing that i dont like.",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I don’t have a huge yard but this trimmer gets the job done. And there is always plenty of battery life left to switch it to my fuel blower to cleanup afterwards.Tony,4
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),Perfect for me. Will also buy the trimmer and possibly the chain saw,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I use the blower as expected, to blow leaves out of my back yard.  It has excellent power and the lack of fumes means I use it more-an unexpected bonus.  I use the 12ah battery that came with my chain saw so run time is also excellent",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"The trimmer works great and is lighter than my old gas one, it also produces less vibration and is safer because the string stops. I wish I had waited another few months when I bought it because the new version where you can change attachments came out. I would rather have the new one, guess that explains why I got it on sale",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I’ve had other battery powered products this is by far the best. The fact that it uses my existing Milwaukee batteries is a plus!,4
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Does not have the same power as a gas trimmer, but for normal yard work its fantastic. Really nice to not have to worry about it starting, because it will as long as the battery is charged.",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),It has the power to trim heavy grass and no mixing gas and oil. Its the perfect length and the correct angle using as an edger. Down side ( maybe) is it heavy. But that just means its strong and ready to work.,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"My leaf blower is great for the driveway, patio, deck, yard or anywhere else you can use a high powered blower.",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Took this out of the box, and found the assembly a snap. First time owning a double string grass trimmer, but removal of the head or replacement of the line doesn’t seem to be difficult at all, just follow the directions. I trim a half acre lot, and this grass trimmer is definitely up to the task. I have not found the need to run at “rabbit” speed, but this trimmer is more than capable of taking down thick vegetation at “rabbit” speed. I have owned and used Milwaukee tools for decades, and have found them to be reliable in every way. Well made and tough. Didn’t realize the charger does both M18 and M12 batteries, a pleasant surprise as I will soon be purchasing the Milwaukee multi-purpose tool. My opinion is you can never go wrong with Milwaukee tools.",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"This tool is Awesome . I use it at my house and my shop . My guys can just grab it and slide a battery in it and take care of the weeds in the yard around my repair shop . It is quiet , instant on and off and if I need that person right away he can put it down and come back later , pick the tool up and finish the job . Restringing it is easily accomplished also.",5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),These hedge trimmers did not disappoint. They can definitely go through sticks up to an inch. Says 3/4” but very powerful and did my whole hedge row and still have 3 bars on battery. Built a lot better than other brands. You definitely get what you pay for,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I originally purchased a competitor’s blower, weed eater and lawnmower (only because Milwaukee still hasn’t released a mover) I thought it would well, until I used the Milwaukee blower at my firehall. The next day I returned my yellow and black model for a Milwaukee. Omg!! So much stronger! Well designed, especially with the integrated key hole hanger in the bottom for wall hanging. Love it!!",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),This blower is great. We no longer have to get our gas powered blower out and take it through the house to blow the leaves off our back deck that is one story off the ground.  (there isn’t a door to the deck from the outside),5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),This is a great product no gas need and long run time only issue I had were screws backing out on handle but they were replaced,4

7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I just use this trimmer as a homeowner in a medium yard. So probably take it out once or twice a month. It definitely could use a back up battery for most bigger jobs. Luckily it’s only ran out of battery once on me. I run it in low and it usually lasts about 45 minutes.,5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),I’ve used a lot of different trimmers in the landscape Industry and the Milwaukee trimmer is the easiest and lightest to use. Very powerful and just feels good in your hands.,5

7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I bought this blower and liked it so much, I bought another one for my son.  I especially liked how the battery is interchangeable with my other Milwaukee M18 Fuel tools, so if my battery is drained, I can use other batteries from my other Milwaukee tools.  The blower is so light weight and easy to use.",5

Same time between 1 battery/ 1 fuel thank 
More light less vibration",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I have two Stihl weed wackers and after purchasing this Milwaukee cordless I gave my two Stihl gas weed wackers away I will never use them again I just wish I would have taken my time and scroll down one more product to get the 9 .0 battery with it for an extra $60 for a $200 plus battery I tried to contact CPO to see if I could pay the difference for the battery or by the weed wacker with the battery and return the other one and the woman I spoke with told me no that is the only problem I have with this purchase besides that this is one of the baddest weed wackers I've ever used in my life,5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),I love this thing. I thought it might be too heavy with the battery but it’s not. Even my wife can use it and she is only 4’11”,5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),Could not be more satisfied with the Milwaukee M18 Hedge Trimmer.  I have an 8' Juniper hedge that is over 100' in length.   The Milwaukee Hedge Trimmer cut my trim time in half.  It has great reach and the battery life is exceptional. A another great product from Milwaukee.,5

7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"Prior to buying this trimmer I did alot of research. I also use alot of Milwaukee M18 products as a maintenance person with good luck. Wasn't sure about trying Milwaukee yard products but I must say WOW! The trimmer is fast, ergonomically great .Did alot of trimming using a 5 amp hr. battery . Still showed 1/2 charge when I was done. Cut my time at least in 1/2 by not having to mess around with cords.",4
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Works great for cleaning grass clippings. Can’t wait for leaf season,5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),So far the weed eater works very well. I don’t really like holding the button down so long because my hand cramps really bad. I wish it had some kind of lock for that. But other than that it seems pretty good.,4
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),Love it. We have a small apple orchard and it does the job on one charge,5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),Ease to use and has plenty of power.  Cut all my shrubs and the batterie still had half a charge.  I will never go back to corded power tool.  I would have given 5 star if it had attachment for other tools.,4

7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Used this in place of my gas trimmer. Just as good maybe better. Hope the gas one don’t gum up from not using it. Battery lasts very long,no fumes. Plenty of power.",5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),Easy to use ..makes clean and even cuts.. long lasting battery,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Very comparable to the Stihl handheld blower it is replacing. Lasts at least an hour with the 12 amp battery. A little more awkward to hold than the Stihl but still gets the job done! I work as a landscaper and the ability to be able to fire this thing up without having to play with the choke and messing around with mixed gas is awesome when cleaning up a small job that doesn’t require a backpack blower,5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"The reach is great for tall hedges, the battery lasts surprisingly long and it’s nice and quiet.",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Everything about it is great so far...I clean out my garage frequently with it and use it on my decks and driveway.,5
7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"Great product, definitely does what I need it to do. I’ve used it on several occasions to cut/trim my juniper bushes and it cuts through them with ease. The same goes for when I use it on a big hedge that I trim in my yard. No problems at all and it never bogs down. It is a bit on the heavy side with the battery, but it’s balanced well and its good performance far outweighs the extra heaviness. Happy with the purchase!",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Milwaukee mean quality and the string trimmer, pole saw and the extension poles are a fantastic addition to my powered yard tool arsenal.  They work better than advertised and the tools can be exchanged very easily and quickly!  They lock in easily and securely to the interchangeable power unit.

Nothing is better than a Milwaukee power tool in your shop, garage or yard shed - well maybe (and that would be many Milwaukee tools)!",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Works great ! Handles the work with ease! Very happy with the product line !,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"We use our Milwaukee blower for landscaping, cleaning the porch, the deck and I even used it for cleaning the gutters. The weight of Milwaukee’s blower allows my wife the freedom to no longer worry about her long hair endangered by side intakes or backpack blowers, the weight and balance allows my wife and kids to use the blower without fatigue. The battery run time is excellent, without changing out batteries to finish the job.",4

7/27/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"It has great power, and battery life. I live on a little 1/4 acre lot. It has 11 large irregular shaped gardens, 12 trees, 10 large granite boulders, and about 300ft of fence. All need to be trimmed. This trimmer handles it all on one charge with usually half battery life remaining.",4
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Overall for around the house I love it. The only concern is occasionally loose clothing gets pulled into the grill on the air intake. I also have the string trimmer and love it, no issues with it.  I would buy them both again.",5
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I use this thing hard. Way easier upkeep. No way would I give this up for gas power again,5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Much more powerful than the original non fuel model, and with the intake in the back you don’t suck your pants in.",5

7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I own a gas powered, a plug in, and a M18 FUEL blower.  The M18 blower is by far my first choice, the others are collecting dust!  It is my first choice because it has trigger variable speed - slow to push leaves out of corners, medium to remove leaves from on top of  mulch without moving the mulch, and high power to moves leaves quickly on paved surfaces and across grass.  It is a great machine, well worth the price.",5
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Lots of power. Only problem was the charger stopped working. I took it back (the charger) and Home Depot replaced for me,5

7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I purchased the M-18 string line trimmer, the hedge trimmer and the blower, plus an extra HD 9.0 Battery.

7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Since buying the m18 Fuel Blower I've used it a lot and it hasn't disappointed. After mowing/trimming it works great for clearing walkways and stairs. I've also used it to dry my car off after washing it. Both scenarios I couldn't be happier with its performance. The only negative remark is the slow setting is entirely to slow. So far I haven't found any reason to use this on slow speed.,4

 Only thing I didn't care for  battery life is short because of the power",4
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I've seen other people complain about it being to loud and stuff. I mean what can you expect.... It's a leaf blower! Come on guys! Anyway I've been using the m18 line for 4 years. But this leaf blower honestly it works great. Has power... But make sure if you plan on getting it to get the new HD High demand 12.0. Since it's a newer model has more power. It'll still work with the other batteries but it won't last to long..  You've been warned.  You want something good be willing to spend the money (invest) on good quality.,4

7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"The Milwaukee trimmer Kept on turning off, has power but always knock off, lite weight, battery lasts good",2
7/27/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"The power of this trimmer is average.  The trimmer does not work as well as my $40 electric trimmer, but it is nice not to drag a cord around the yard.  The San Augustine grass seems like it is just too thick for this trimmer, especially when edging along the sidewalk.  I have been impressed by the length of battery life.",4
7/27/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"We use it to blow the snow and leaves/dirt in the summer. Works fabulous! Recommend to anyone. Light, east to hold and use and not very loud.

7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I was attracted to this trimmer by the easy load head...just thread the trimmer line through the head after lining up the two red marks and then crank the line on the internal spool.  What I wasn't expecting was the power, and how long the battery life is.  I can trim our 2+ acre yard with perimeter fence 3 times before the battery will be close to needing a charge.",5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),One of the best trimmers that I have used. Not to heavy for me and I have bad elbows. I have a large yard and I have used just 1 battery which really impressed me. I would recommend this to all the ladies out there.,5

My initial use was for an overgrown bank, cut 24inch high grass/weeds with no problem. The easy load head is great for loading string. wish the battery lasted longer, will have to purchase another so I can continue the weed while the other is charging. would definitely recommend.",5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Wish it was variable speed, gave 4 stars because there is always room for improvement., way better than mixing gas make sure your using high demand batteries it won’t like the smaller ones",4

7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),Mostly comfortable to handle.  Haven’t had to re-string the head yet so that will be interesting to see.  The battery is kick butt !,5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Use for work and personal use.  Blow out dirt and dust from inside buildings.  Use around residential for cleaning up yards, blowing out rain gutters filled with leaves.  Very powerful, like high and low power settings.  Operating noise level is good. Like it better than my 2 cycle Stihl leaf blower.  Light enough and easy to use for the my wife and kids.  Thank You for a GREAT product.",5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Hit the jackpot with this tool. Convenient, with plenty of power and good battery life. I am pleased!",5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I bought this thinking the versatility would be nice to have. I was wrong it’s great! Overall it’s a bit heavy but it’s power and run time both are excellent! The best part isn’t wife can easily do the trimming when I’m out of town on business. She enjoys the ease of operation. So far I also have the pole saw attachment as well and used it to clean up along the side of our house, super satisfied!!",5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I got this weed eater because who has time to worry about mixed gas, broken primer bulb, or replacing spark plugs? Then there’s cleaning the carburetor because it won’t idle or bogs at full throttle? I’m just trying to mow the lawn. This Milwaukee weed eater makes it convenient by simple being ready to go at any given moment. I literally pick it up and squeeze the trigger. Paired with their 9.0 battery you barely even have to charge it. I’d recommend this to any DIY’er to use around their home.",5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Excellent Recommended have power ande the battery is perfect,5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),Love having a battery operated string trimmer. I simply pull the trigger and it’s on. No more messing around with gas or winterizing the motor. Just pop a battery on and go. Cuts the same as more old gas trimmer too. My only complaint is I bought a Gen I and 6 months later the Gen II came out.,5
7/28/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),Like all my Milwaukee tools this this hedge trimmer attachment is top notch,5

7/28/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),I have an entire armada of Milwaukee tools for wood working and had been thinking of trying the yard work line. The Fuel Hedge Trimmer was my first Milwaukee yard work machine but will not be my last. I was originally concerned about how long it would run on battery. Two of us went head to head gas vs battery and unbeleivably the battery lasted longer than the Stihl. The big bonus was way less noise as well allowing me to work earlier at client homes not disturbing them.,5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I use the blower to effortlessly sweep up in the front and backyard areas. However what I truly love about this compact blower is when I use it to blow off the remaining water off of my vehicle at the car wash.  Works great and on numerous occasions have been asked about the blower and  where to purchase the item.,5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Love this trimmer, since buying this trimmer I will be replacing all my gas tools with Milwaukee battery tools.",5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),Had to take the battery back. It shorted out after a week,3
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"We have huge trees in our back yard with a lot of leaves and pods.  We were told about the Milwaukee blowers by our contractor that renovated our bathroom. Our blower has been a serious lifesaver!!  Our other blowers were like using a feather duster compared to our Milwaukee blower.  It is so powerful!  We used our first blower to death.  We weren't completely sure it was under warranty, so we bought a new one, and still sent the other in.  They were great and fixed our old one.  We now have two!!  This is a great company and they make GREAT products and stand by their word!!",5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Works great.  Battery life is awesome.  Only  thing it needs is a shoulder strap, cause it lasts so long my arms get tired.",5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I like the ease of use of this blower for fall leaves and light snow. Works great on blowing the snow off the car in the morning. No cord is a bonus.,4
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),It is perfect for cleaning debris off of roofs and cleaning up afterwards,5

7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I bought the blower right after I purchased the string trimmer, I use the blower all the time.  If I’m on the job site, I don’t need a broom anymore, it’s quick and easy to get rid of messes.",5
7/28/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),Added the trimmer to compliment the string trimmer and blower that I already had. Cordless hedge trimmer is very high quality. Trims forever without using up the battery. Highly recommend this hedge trimmer. It’s a little heavy but cuts cleanly and better than corded trimmers I have used.,5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I had another cordless 24 volt that I added .135 twisted strong.  The Milwaukee 18 FUEL performs 2-3 levels higher.  WoW,5

No cord 
Powerful 
Rugged",5
7/28/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","I have been using this 16"" chainsaw around the house and property for a few months now and I find myself reaching for it more often than my gas saw with a 17"" bar.  They are similar weight wise but not having to deal with the engine noise and 2-cycle fuel really stands this saw apart.  I also haven't run across any issues with running out of power before I ran out of things to cut, and that's not even counting my spare battery.",5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"My overall first impression was the absolute power of this blower. I have a 1,100 sq. Ft. Patio along with a 1,100 sq. Ft deck that is easily handled by this blower. I am impressed with the ability to blow material long distances with this unit. Since buying the blower I have added the Weed Trimmer and Edger. That thing is a BEAST!!!!!",5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),If the blower tip was a little narrower I think it might have a little more force but am pleased with the performance. It's not that heavy and easy to operate. I like that I can use the same batteries from my Milwaukee drills and charger on this.,5
7/28/2019,48-11-2401,M12™ REDLITHIUM™ CP1.5 Battery Pack,"Got three of these new. One after one discharge would no longer charge. Another stopped charging after another month of use. Charger says they are fully charged, but they contain no charge. Not really used heavily so it is surprising that they would fail so quickly.",1
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Awesome product! Extremely convenient to use for any job battery life is great and recharges quickly.,5
7/28/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),These hedge trimmers will trim all my hedges and the battery still has 3/4 charge. Great product for the money!,5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Super light weight and surprisingly powerful. Incredibly convenient with the plug and play M18 battery system that's last much longer than I have needed.,5

7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Tackles 3 foot tall field grass on my fence line with ease, roughly 750 feet battery life is great, would recomend nylon blade head if you're going to cut heavy weeds IE thistles. I bought mine with the free promo pole saw, that attachment will zip through a 4"" branch with ease. Trimmer has excellent balance, weight wise no different then my old gas rig it replaced. I can not wait to add the chain saw kit with the new 12.0 battery. Love the M18 line up!",4
7/28/2019,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit",Great cutting performance and almost 3 hours of battery with constant cutting. Tree fell in parents backyard after storm and cut whole thing on 1 charge of battery. Not as dirty as gas powered chainsaws either. Would highly recommend.,5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),This trimmer is great! My husband loves it and so do I! I love that it is easy to use and not heavy. Does a great job and is self-stringing!,5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I love my string trimmer. Ican go all the way around the house and the trees and the flower gardens and still have batt.left.The best thing is i don't have to wonder if it will start or if I have gas. Just pull the trigger and it works.,1
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"This is a great blower for whenever your too lazy to use a broom. I love it but be prepared with extra batteries. Life of a fully charged 3.0 on full is only about 10-12 minutes max, of course longer in the lower setting. I would definitely recommend to anyone as long as they have extra batteries for whenever the battery conks out.",4
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Both blower and trimmer are light, lots of power and very convenient not having to fill with gas.",5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Man, this thing blows- get it....blows. Serious power.  Doesn’t vibrate your arm like gas.  I use this for everything- mostly blowing shingle scraps and nails off the roof after tearing off.  Just shows me that Milwaukee is serious about putting the best tools out there for professional use.  Only thing- your 5 battery drains after 20-25 minutes of usage.  But highly highly recommend this product for its power.",5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I have 2.5 acres of land with lots of stuff to trim around. I used to have to mix gas. Always have gas on hand and make sure it ran right in order to trim my yard. Always a hassle to deal with especially for someone with little time to keep up with these things. Since purchasing the m18 string trimmer I can use it with ease. I put a m18 12.0 battery in it and cut. I lower my speed around stuff that is more fragile. I can set it down to move stuff and pick it back up start right where I left off. This was the best purchase I have ever bought. I love it so much I talked everyone I know into buying one as well. It makes me life so much easier. I am also a builder/contractor and own almost every cordless Milwaukee tool made , my employees and I use only Milwaukee cordless for every job we do and I know hands down they are the best. Batteries outlast anything else on the market. The power is just as good if not better then a corded tool. I am a Milwaukee tool nut for sure but only because they are the best. I believe to do the best work you have to have the best tools. Milwaukee has changed my job and how we do our job. It has increased productivity and made things so much easier. Thanks Milwaukee. Keep making the best.",5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Received as a Christmas gift. Powerful wide pattern, light weight, great for clean up after hedge trimming, blowing off porch and drive. Even used after stripping off old roof. Only reason I didn't give five stars was its hunger for batteries. Great product!",4
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),The battery lasts a long time and lots of power even with the 3 amp battery,5
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I use it to blow the maple keys off the deck and outdoor furniture at home. Being small and gas free I take it to the cottage too when the fish flies cover it. 2 minutes and they’re gone. You do need a larger 3+ battery for larger jobs.,4
7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I had a great Stihl gas blower.  Problem was getting it to start.  After a short period, the carb failed under warranty.  everything was great until carb failed again.  price to fix, same as buying a new one.  Opted for the much more quiet Milwaukee blower.  my wife can use it because there is no starting issue.  she loves that.  insisted that i get a sawzall.   Got Milwaukee and she loves it too.  At some point, maybe she does all the yard work?  Love my Milwaukee products.  also purchased the 1/2 drill and flashlite.  Bye, bye Stihl.",5
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),This thing is powerful! I did my whole yard with less than 1 battery,5

7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),The blower works awesome my only reason for a four-star is because you have to buy the huge battery to let it run for more than five minutes,4
7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Trimming the lawn , found very comfortable to use once I bought the strap

7/28/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),It is way better than my old gas trimmers and is Milwaukee tough.,5

7/28/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I had a two speed corded blower. The Milwaukee blows it away. Plenty of power to clean up the decks and sidewalks in a quarter of the time. It has two speeds and a trigger that gives you the ability to control the blower speed imitate settings. Hi power to clear the decks and sidewalks and low power to clean around the potted plants around the pond. I can finish the job with a 2AH battery and my 5AH battery I can go 3 times without recharging. It is well balanced and easy to co control with precision.,5

7/28/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),I've had different electric hedge trimmers and a gas hedge trimmer.  This M18 kicks all their butts!

I settled on this one and do not regret it one bit! The soft textured top and button is super convenient and has become one of my favorite features. The clip is strong and durable unlike the competitors. Best of all, the LED light is very bright and well focused for all sorts of tasks. The battery life is good, I use mine 5 days a week and haven't changed the batteries in over a month. Fantastic product at a very reasonable price.",5
7/28/2019,49-16-2714,Easy Load Trimmer Head,"Poor head construction. Did not last a full season before the plastic head wore down to almost nothing. I love the trimmer, but hate the plastic head. I would like to see a bump head in the future that’s reinforced.",1

7/29/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"This is great for small jobs. Less than 15 min with a fully charged extra large battery. XC4.0 and less with the CP2.0. 
I am not of fan of walking around with an extra battery in my hand waiting for one to give out, and maybe finish with the second. Then having to carry them back along with posible trash to charge, then complete the job.",2

7/29/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Right out of the box it worked like a champ. I use it around the house and it has become my go tool versus a broom or the gas blower. We live in a heavily wooded area and fighting leaves is a full time job. This is the tool for the job. The choice of turtle or rabbit really helps in tight areas. Battery life is really good too. The balance of the tool couldn't be much better. Couldn't be happier with it!,5
7/29/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),This weed whip works great and the added pole saw attachment was awesome!,5
7/29/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),We bought the blower to use on our rescue truck.  We use it for high volume air flow in confined space and to remove debris off the roadway.   Puts out plenty of volume.  Only thing wish the could reduce the nozzle.,5

The tool is fairly easy to manage and well-balanced. I used it with a 5Ah XC battery and was able to trim everything in my yard, with charge to spare. I was surprised by how quiet it is...quieter than my 25 year-old corded Craftsman and much quieter than the gas powered trimmer I was thinking about buying. This trimmer is a high quality tool from a high quality company.",5
7/29/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Bought this because the battery matched the M18 Fuel Trimmer I bought earlier this year.  My first battery powered blower, but not my first battery powered lawn tool.  The Milwaukee products have been great, much easier than my older gas tools, much more powerful & longer life than any other battery powered lawn tool I've used in the past.",5
7/29/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Easy and versatile. I tote it around for simple cleanups. Just cut down some limbs for my in-law, it’s powerful and blew branches and leaves out of the grass for me. Who needs a rake when you got this blower!",5

7/29/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),This thing is a monster!!! Cuts through the thickest of grass and weeds very well. It is probably the easiest string trimmer to load I've ever owned. It does drain the older batteries very quickly so have extras on hand.

I have an acre lot completely fenced in and I can get everything trimmed on one 12amp battery and still have juice to switch over to my blower to clean up the mess. The line feed on the trimmer head is the smoothest I've ever used. I'm hooked for life!,5

7/29/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"Needed a weed eater but did not want another gas engine tool to care for. I already use Milwaukee everything. Lots of red in my shop. 
My expectation was that it would handle the light trimming around my house. Expectations blown away. This summer I used it to tackle an overgrown are behind my fence and I was able to knock down 2-3 feet of weeds including this heavy milkweed plants. The area is 30’ x 55’ and I did it all with only one recharge. I did not buy this tool to do that kind of clearing but it took it on no problem. 
Lastly I can’t say enough about the convenience of sharing batteries across all my cordless tools. I trim around the lawn then take that battery off, plug it into the Milwaukee blower and finish the job.",5

7/29/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I love the Milwaukee brand and purchased this blower through a local retailer. From the first use the battery dies within 2-3 minutes of consistent use. Its not even enough time to get my driveway blown off after mowing.,1
7/29/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I love the control and volume of air it pushes. Cleans my roof and patio in no time. The one downfall for me is the high pitch whining the motor makes when using it.,4

First the Primer bulb,then the choke, then that stupid rope, then hope it starts. My new Milwaukee M18 Fuel is a whole new world. It's more powerful than the gas trimmers, and does a better job.

7/29/2019,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"First trimmer I bought had to be returned due to a battery that would not charge.Returned it to Home Depot after several months. They would only give me store credit. Bought a second trimmer knowing this was just a fluke. I took out a two year extended warranty on the second one. Milwaukee Tool should have a two year warranty on their products. Milwaukee is the best, right? Come on Milwaukee. Step up to the plate. Your sales would go thru the roof.",4
7/29/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),Selected this blower because of existing M18 powered Milwaukee tools.  Outstanding CFM capability on high speed and low speed.  It does the job.  Tired of keeping gas STIHL blower and leaf vac running.,5

7/29/2019,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),"I have been using this string trimmer all season now with a 9amp battery and have been loving it. It definitely is a proud addition with my other Milwaukee tools. This Machine Cuts absolutely all grass and tall weeds you point at. Very quiet operation even on high speed which I'm sure keeps neighbors happy. Trigger control and 2 selectable speeds have been a big selling point depending on area and amount of grass/weed growth. Typically trimming on low speed for residential use. I have two negative comments. FIRST is the guard shield is to small and almost always causes fresh cut debris to be thrown at my legs. Even after changing cutting direction and angle of attack  I still have debris being thrown generally in my direction sometimes even upward. I have never experienced that before, so i reccomend a wider guard to help deflect debris down and away from my standing position. SECOND is wishing a shoulder strap was included as the weight can fatigue you depending on task. Trimmer is well balanced however.  I noticed a strap can be purchased at a home depot but online only in Canada. I still have yet to purchase a strap but plan on it to help my back. Battery run time is great and what I expected.  This trimmer feels strong and sturdy.  The quick reel for restringing I believe is the best one on the market. Sometimes I wonder if I should of purchased the quick lock style but am still proud to own this and show its bright red colour off.",4
7/29/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I have to admit, I didn't read the manual.  I had the blower for over a month and used it a lot and was impressed.  Then one day I must have bumped the button to high speed and wow!  its even more impressive!",5

7/30/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I originally bought this blower to use around the house but it works so good I started using it on the job site as well. I like the dual speeds. I click it down to low and use it to “sweep up”. High speed will take care of most debris with little effort. The only draw back is battery life is short when blowing on high. It is also light weight and easy to handle.,5
7/30/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I never owned a battery powered Blower.  I was worried about battery life but not anymore. It works great for grass, leaves, dust, and gravel. I also love the fact that I won’t have to clean the gas lines every few years.",5

7/30/2019,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"Bought this as part of the fuel Quik Lok trimmer/Blower combo. I must say it has performed flawlessly. Works very well blowing off drive, patio, and sidewalks after trimming and mowing and the  sweeping out of garage. Easy to maneuver and use. My first use of it ran through a 5ah battery in about 20-25 minutes but now I use the 9.0 battery that came with trimmer to trim and edge, then swap it to the blower. You will notice more power from the blower using the 9.0 with the same ease of use and I can finish up with at least 2 bars still showing on the battery so I effectively double my use before recharging.  Very happy and impressed with this unit as it has effectively replaced my gas powered blower/leaf mulching which cost considerably more.",5

After about 2 months of use the left side of the bag got a permanent crease in it and so the bag leans forward badly when the bag is fully opened. In order to retrieve tools i must support the bag with one hand and fumble for tools with the other hand. For the money theyre asking for the bag I thought i would hold up better. I didnt even have that many tools in it. Unloaded the bag feels fine on your back, but once it is loaded you can really feel the weight. The bag is a bit cumbersome just to put on your shoulders when loaded. Once on your back it just doesnt feel ergonomic. My main gripe is the creased left side of the bag causing it to lean over.",1

I must say I'm impressed, i like that it has 2 speeds. I use the low speed for in my flower beds, something I couldn't do with my gas one,  as not to damage the plants and flowers.

Eventually, 22 days ago, a Milwaukee representative responds with ""We would like the opportunity to investigate your feedback further""! Really? If the fact that people are removing a set screw that should not be removed - because THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS otherwise - is not enough information, certainly the post by T_Soup 6 months ago (""How It Works, With Technical Info"") should make it very clear.
Please, include instructions in the package and do something to prevent the set screw for the locking pin from being easily removed.

I had the same battery in the saw for 2 months making cuts here and there through standard 2 x 4 & 4 x 4 boards. The cut is effortless and clean. It never seems to bog down, and if it does, it's because I have it in a bind. Then the red link safety cuts it out and avoids a crazy kickback.

I use my saws daily to help fabricate jigs for my projects.  The power of my jigsaw is fantastic.  It's very maneuverable as well, and I feel the cuts are excellent.  The only gripe I have is dust collection.  It sucks (or doesn't, depending on your perspective).  The vacuum attachment reduces down so far that my shop-vac is screaming, as if I'd just covered the inlet altogether.  

I would really like to see Milwaukee put out something that attaches at the front in place of the blade guard and has a ""full-size"" opening for my shop-vac (or dust collector).  I end up just taking off the blade guard and holding my shop-vac beside the blade for the time being.  I'll be fabricating something this week to bolt on to the base (it has four tapped holes at the front).",4

I ended up buying a combo kit from Home Depot when it went on sale and was able to pick up multiple M18 tools for an ok price.  All of them are great except this drill.  Power is fine, but finish quality is substandard.  The trigger sometimes catches, the button that alternates between forward and reverse gets stuck and the selector switch on top for increasing torque takes brute force to switch back and forth.  I expected more stringent quality control at this price point.  All the other M18 tools I bought with it are great.",3

I thought for sure because of the size it may have little torque or power, but I was so wrong. This saw packs a punch. It can cut through plywood at amazing speeds for a cordless saw.

This Milwaukee is awesome. Once it is dialed in to the desired depth, it was flawless. I've only used it on oak materials and no issues with the quality. Only complaint is that it is very loud, so when using it in small rooms, hearing protection is highly recommended.

2/15/2020,2505-20,M12 FUEL™ Installation Drill/Driver,"I bought this after seing a YouTube review.  I already had the 2760 drill driver and was not sure if this one could serve a purpose along side my existing tool.  The answer is yes.  It does not have the power of the drill driver, but it can get at many more situations.  It can do it with a ¼"" hex bit , but it can also use the drill chuck to grab onto drill bits or other things like wire wheel brushed.

THe profile of this tool is very different as well.  Much thinner and it has a magnetic area in teh forward handle that can grab onto extra bits.  The are some differences between the M12 tool and the M18 - namely the battery level gauge is on the tool and not the battery (which is actually easier because all you have to do is look at it rather than pressing a button), and the forward/reverse switch is a button on the tool as opposed to the M18 switch that you can hit with your hand holding teh tool normally.

The installation drill/driver is a very useful tool that I have really enjoyed having in my tool lineup.  Thanks Milwaukee for another greta tool!",5

I have been in the landscape maintenance business for 30 years.  We offer tree trimming on small to medium size trees, 25 to 30 foot or less.  A 10 or 12 inch bar will suffice for 90 percent of the cutting we do.

Perfectly designed for the finesse cut that you can’t get with a recip saw. It is easy to hold and control and the reversing blade rotation is genius. I have used it to cut nails, wood trim, plastic pipe, sheet metal, vinyl flooring, and drywall. It should work great for trimming a fender, cutting a tail pipe, plumbing, remodeling, etc.  this is already my most-used tool next to my drill.",5

The front lever for the angle adjustment needs a stop to keep the lever from spinning on the nut, this however is a relatively small issue considering the power of the saw and going cordless.",4

I wasn’t sure if I should get the 3/8” or 1/2” version, but even my M12 stubby impact I’m constantly using 1/2” sockets with an adapter. So I went with the 1/2” and I’m glad I did. So far it’s saving a ton of wear and tear on my high torque impact and it’s much smaller and lighter. I think it’s a fantastic addition to my lineup.",5

2/15/2020,2554-20,"M12 FUEL™ 3/8"" Stubby Impact Wrench",I bought this to use at home working on everything from automotive to small engine repairs.

2/15/2020,2804-20,M18 FUEL™ ½” Hammer Drill/Driver (Tool Only),This drill is an amazing piece of equipment. The reason i use that choice word is because it isn't a ordinary drill.

2/15/2020,2460-20,M12™ Cordless Rotary Tool (Tool Only),Used this to cut out some dust boxes on couple metal door frames.  On the second one it got extremely hot after about 2 minutes of continuous use.  Turned it off for a while turned it back on later in the day and right after it started I smelled electronic la burning.  Lights just started blinking and wouldn’t run again.  Probably the worst Milwaukee tool I’ve ever purchased.,1
2/15/2020,2485-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Right Angle Die Grinder","The die grinder is on the bulky side for the power in comparison to its traditional air counterparts, however it does take a fair bit of force to stall it out. I don’t recommend it for continuous cutting with a zip disc, it can do it...but you will drain a 4ah battery in a couple minutes. Works great with roloc disc attachments and burrs, haven't tried sanders on it yet but I have no doubt they will work well with it. A couple recommendations for future versions would be to angle the light away from the fingers, and when the tool stalls, have it pulse the motor at one second intervals to check if the load has been removed from the tool. If it has, then the tool can start again without resetting the trigger.",4
2/15/2020,48-22-8451,Customizable Foam Insert,Great idea. But the insert is not easy to get the right fit on the tool you are trying to fit.  Layers are very hard to peel apart.  Would also be nice if you made them for the compact packout as well,2

2/14/2020,48-22-8221,"18"" Jobsite Rolling Bag",I love Milwaukee products and this bag is perfect for my needs. Unfortunately after a year the front zipper has broken and one of the wheels wobbles I wish it had lasted longer.

2/14/2020,48-22-1503,FASTBACK™ Folding Utility Knife Set,"Milwaukee FASTBACK Folding Utility Knife is a treat to use with its quick switch blade type opening set up. I watched a builder use one of these and knew I had to have one since it is so easy to operate. I lucked out with a two-pack = one for the tool belt and one for the bench. I wish these had come with bi-metal blades because, then there would be no better knife to be had; an easy fix, though. One has a string cutting feature, wire stripper. The quick change, no tool blade changing feature is a bonus. It says it will hold up to five extra blades, but I could only get it closed with four.",5

What i got back was not my impact as it was all scuffed up and had no power. I contacted warrany service on this matter and sent it back in for repair a second time. I got the same impact back with no change. It will not even back off a lug nut at 130 ft lbs.",1
2/14/2020,2485-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Right Angle Die Grinder","I finally had the chance to use my new Christmas present so I removed the one inch wire cup brush from my air die grinder and mounted it to my new Milwaukee right angle die grinder. I installed a fully charged 4.0ah battery so I could remove some light rust from a sheet of steel. I put the grinder at the #1 setting and squeezed the paddle trigger. I lightly placed the wire brush against the steel plate and the grinder stopped after a couple seconds. I released the paddle and tried again with the same result. Next I tried the 2,3, and 4 settings with the same result. I replaced the battery with another fully charged battery with the same results. I removed the wire cup from the grinder and put it back in my air grinder so I could finish my work.

Come on Milwaukee I expect better than this from you guys",2
2/14/2020,2730-20,"M18 FUEL™ 6-1/2"" Circular Saw (Tool Only)","I bought this specifically for size vs power. The 7.25"" seemed a little big for what I needed, I still keep a corded 7.25"" in the trailer. This is for quick cuts along the way. The left side blade is a little tricky to get used to... but the saw is light enough so you can control the kickback or biting with your right hand. For precision.... it is very nice to see the whole blade (using your right hand).

My headlamp is working, thanks to a new battery, and I can now wholeheartedly recommend this product.

2/12/2020,2871-22,M18 FUEL™ Sewer Sectional Machine w/ CABLE DRIVE™,"Ok so I bought this machine on preorder and I tested it out without having put the cable in the drain and I thought it didn't work and it was defective.The rep brought me his brand new machine and it was doing the same thing.The issue is the clutch.In order for the machine to work you have to have the cable under tension,You either have to hold the cable (with a bit of tension)or place the cable down a drain where the cable has tension and the clutch will engage and the cable will move forward like any other drain cleaning machine.Now once the machine is going you can either manually go forward and the cable will go at a slow spped or you can use the autofeed feature.The autofeed is actually pretty fast and at times too fast where you will disengage it.
There is a differance beween this machine and a drum machine.The cables for this machine are open wound so it's more flexible and springy vs a cable from a drum machine.The difference being the drum machine is very heavy becasue you have a thinner cable that stays in the drum and the sectional machine is lighter but requires more work space because the cables are loaded from the rear of the machine in 15 ft sections.Ths machine has a good amount of torque for sure and I see why they are using 12 amp hour batteries.It does use up juice because of the torque required to push the cable down the drain.It's a nice machine and it does take a bit of getting used too if this is your first sectional drain cleaning machine.Having the auto clutch feature means you don't need to manually change it when using another size cable.The Milwaukee rep was very nice and they went all out to try and solve the issue.These machines take a bit more time to use vs a drum machine but they are so much lighter and for me that's a huge benefit.The large diameter cable will help in larger sized drains.Thanks again to Milwaukee for helping out with the issue.",5

This particular box I can't find but one thing wrong with In the center of the box, there is a Groove that looks like it's for a divider but there Is no divider That comes with it And I cannot find one anywhere online or in any stores. I think it would be a good idea to put a divider in with this box Which would be a great benefit to the user. If it had the center divider I would be  More than happy to give this box a 5 star rating. Other than that I really like the boxes And I would tell anyone to buy one. It's a really great system and I plan to buy more. Thank you for your time.",3
2/12/2020,2950-20,M18™ PACKOUT™ Radio + Charger,"I'm not shur if my opinion really counts but here I go.  I'm a great fan of Milwaukee tools. I always recommend the best tools possible. And usually I recommend Milwaukee tools cus you usually get the best bang for your buck.  But working in a shop environment and occasionally on sight and being and avid DIYer your packout system (with a bit of third party add on's) works absolutely great for my needs.  I was really looking forward to this packout radio. A buddy of mine got one and I was sad to say the power was quite  underwhelming. On sight it nice but in the shop you struggle to hear it unless your right next to it. The other issue is that it only charges the m18 batteries. This is kinda a deal breaker for me. Almost everyone I know Professionally or through a hobby group or just a felow DIYer use a mix of m18 and m12. For the price tag it should be able to charge both and at the same time.   I know you have that little USB thing to charge m12 batteries but that thing is so dam slow. To charge an m12 6.0 on that would take all day.  Iv tried it on a couple of my 4.0s.  But not to get off topic. Love your tools I just think this one needs to go back on the drawing board.
Sincerely a big fan.",3

But that is about it it is very awkward to use unless you are in the perfect position and that doesn’t happen most of the time it isn’t comfortable in your hand the back of the crimper is to heavy it’s not balanced well.  Also the release button is in a awful place when you are working hot primary you can’t have both hands on the crimper you need one on the wire I wish they would go back to the drawing board with this and make it more one handed user friendly.

My biggest complaint is that the saw flexes on the rails, making bevel cuts inaccurate or adding a slight bevel to a 90°. I’m extremely careful and gentle when pulling the saw down so I don’t flex the rails and this doesn’t always fix the flex. The saw has good power. However, I wish it had a corded option as most of the time my cut stations are not that mobile. I take care of my tools but taking care and working slow in this case doesn’t fix the problem and is too harmful to production. I definitely wouldn’t use this as a trim saw and I don’t do a lot of framing with a miter saw so I have no use for this saw. I wanted to give two stars but decided on one because of the high price for low quality and the fact that I’m not keeping it. Unfortunately, I’ll have to get something else.",1

The band is fully stretched to the max and will lose its elasticity over time. The power cable is also stretched putting to much tension on the entrance/exit points of the battery and light. To help replace the stress is to put the battery off to the side but no longer feels balanced on your head. If you are in the trades not sure if it will work with non full brim hard hats. I’m assuming it will since Milwaukee includes hard hat clips. Do not recommend for full brim hard hats.,3

I am very pleased with all other M12 and M18 tools i have. I got this tool almost right after it came out and was very excited to try it out. I am an autobody tech and use lots of air die grinders so it would have been great to replace them all with battery powered ones. 
I do like that the grinder is very portable and that is probably the only reason I will keep it. I found that as a grinder it works fine for small jobs but i tried using it for a door skin replacement and found it to be almost usless, because as soon as you use it for a few minutes it gets really hot, and kills 3amp batteries in a few minutes. changing that door skin i used 4 3amp batteries, and finally grabed my air die grinder to finish up. For any other attachments(cut-off wheel, abrasive wheel, carbide bit) i found if pretty useless aswell because it cuts out waaay to early. it feels like the tool would have to power to do the jobs ,but it is set to cut out too early. also when it gets warm from using then it cuts out even quicker.
So in the end i am very dissapointed in this tool for what i need it. If milwaukee changed the cut out point then i would love it. But i will still continue using it for small jobs and where i dont have air to hook up.",2

I have used this to cut open hollow metal door frames to prep for electric strikes, prep aluminum frames surface mounted rim strikes and cut open headers to prep for heavy duty surface bolts.  This tool has countless uses.  The tool will cut off if you push too much into your work piece, so it’s important to let the wheel do the cutting with out pushing too much.  Keep the RPM’s up and it wont cut off.  The tool will burn through some batteries quickly.  I am currently using Milwaukee 4.0 M12 batteries.  I can use up a fully charged battery with continuous use in less than 15 minutes. Continuous use means non stop cutting.  The tool gets in tight place’s easily compared to the larger cut off tools.

2/23/2020,48-22-9214,4pc Pry Bar Set,"I've had these pry bars for over a year as an automotive technician and they have held up great. As another reviewer mentioned, the chrome finish does chip at times, and mine are well worn, but I didn't buy these for aesthetics! The sharper angle on the pry bars is good at times and more difficult at other times, but there's give and take in any design. I lost one of my pry bars and was disappointed to find that I could not order them individually. Ended up ordering a professional quality pry bar off of amazon that works fine, although I prefer the Milwaukee handles. The case/tray is nice to have as well, although if you're not working out of a large toolbox you may have difficulty using it, as it's not as compact as some of the tool truck pry bar trays. 

Overall, tool truck quality at an excellent price, would recommend to anyone, apprentice or master technician.",5

I like that the blower is light, there are 2 speed modes & a button that keeps it running without a need to constantly press the button.

I needed to drive some long screws and that was putting a load on my drill. I bought this and the screws went in like a warm knife through hot butter. Using the hex bits means no slipping and the percussion helps drive the screws easily. There are a lot of advantages of being able to screw framing instead of nailing it and this little unit makes that very easy. I also needed to bolt a vanity to the wall and easily drove 6” screws through the legs and into the studs. No way will a drill handle that.,4

Also, I've noticed that with continuous use, the light head gets hot, and then the battery dies out, so I started carrying a spare battery on me, which helps, but I expected more from Milwaukee. I have the M12 and M18 tool platforms and use them all; great stuff. My thoughts are, they need much better battery technology and a dual USB battery flashlight would be a much better all-day use solution.

All of these sit on a metal rack in my garage and do not come to the worksite with me. They are just storage bins I use to neatly organize my work things screws, nails etc. They are falling apart in less than 3 months. Particularly the pins in the handle drop out. The next time I pick up a bin the handle fails and the bin either hits the floor or I try to catch it out of reflex. Currently 16 of these bins have no usable handle, which makes them useless.

2/20/2020,2110-21,USB Rechargeable 700L Flashlight,"I fell in love with this flashlight when I first got it as a gift. It is bright, lightweight, and easy to carry. Unfortunately, after about a month of using it, the charge port broke. After taking a look I could clearly see one of the pins was snapped off and therefore the flashlight would not take a charge at all. The battery was still good. I figured that it was my fault and that I may have been puttin the chrg cord in too rough (And at all times I only used the Milwaukee chrg cord that came with it). Anyway I decided to purchase another one. Again, I loved the flashlight. And this time being very aware of the previous issue I had, I was very careful everytime I plugged the chrgr in, and careful with where it was set, so that it wasnt anywhere that it would get tripped over or anything that could possibly affect the chrg process or the chrgr port. Unfortunately again, even after I was completely careful with it everyday, It happened again..!! The same exact issue with the chrg port and the tiny missing pin. It did last 2months this second time, but nevertheless, it broke. It is still extremely frustrating... I think that the flashlight could be wonderful if that chrg port wasn't an issue. About a week later a buddy of mine informed me that he also had that same problem. So after hearing that  I decided to cut my loss and not buy another. I would reccomend this product 200% If that port breaking wasn't an issue.  But after it happening twice in only a few months with me and then with a friend.. I can't in good conscience reccomend spending $70 on something that(in my experience) has a high rate of malfunctioning...Even if u save the receipt and can exchange it.

While I'll concur with the other reviewers that's it a fairly hefty attachment, it's also built like a tank, as one might expect from this brand. It cuts through large stems and small branches surprisingly well and only jams if I get overly ambitious and try to cut stuff that is clearly too large for it. I'm a moderately fit 45 year old male and I still need to take breaks every few minutes while pruning due to the weight but I've been able to use this while perched on a tall ladder and even with the extension pole so I consider it reasonably manageable for most (especially when used properly with the shoulder sling) but for some, the smaller stand-alone trimmer may be more appropriate I would think.",5

The case seems very robust. I would buy it again.
The bad: The buttons are hard to push and impossible with a glove. It needs a mute button. When the boss (the wife) comes over, I need to either push the difficult buttons to lower the volume or turn it off which means it needs to reconnect with bluetooth which can take 15 to 30 seconds.

This tool will teach you to use some technique in your cutting as well, cause like with all cordless cutting tools, the battery will get hot really quick if you reef on it.

2/29/2020,2746-21CT,M18 FUEL™ 18 Gauge Brad Nailer Kit,"Being honest not sure I and the crew have used to nailer enough to do a informative review. We have used the 18 gauge nailer on several pieces of trip and crown sizes. It does ok but takes some getting use to as to where the nail is actually going to hit, but mostly because the rubber bumper is very flimsy and wants to bend when you push down against to trim. Seems very cheap quality. With our air nailer the bump guide is very sturdy.
Also I purchased to 15 gauge nailer at the same time and it didn’t last two weeks and just quite firing. The suppler replaced it with no issues but said they had received several back for the same issue. I love Milwaukee tools but I need tools that last, I can’t afford tools that break. But again to be fair, I love not having a hose getting tangled and saving time getting out less equipment. But I need to use this equipment at least 6 mounts before I can tell other, “ Yes I would or wouldn’t buy this again.",3

It was really nice to not have to deal with tripping over the hose or having an air hose connector drop on fresh tile. 
Sure the milwaukee brad nailer is heavy and towards the end of the day after holding it at arm’s-length for a while i was a bit shakey, but that’s because i don’t do this kinda thing often; i probably would’ve found the air gun with hose just as taxing over the same period. 
I went through at least 500 nails on a 5.0 battery over 3 days and it never indicated less 4 of 4 bars of charge.

The perfect power ratchet would be the same size as a standard ratchet handle, so not possible. This one is big, so it's not gonna get everywhere you need it, but for 80% of jobs it's great! Torque is good enough to break a bold head if you're not careful. The body near the battery is a little flexible so you have to choke up a bit to give it the beans, but you're gonna use a torque wrench anyway, right??",5

I love the tool but it’s my third Milwaukee tool I have had to replace instead of repair after having no luck with customer service support and sending tools to be repaired.

I am on an industrial contract and this has been my go to all day every single day the last two months 6 days a week and i have not been upset one time. Milwaukee has delivered yet again.

PLEASE MAKE A SIMPLE CIGARETTE LIGHTER 12V PLUG  ADAPTER, WITH A 14' CORD, SO YOU CAN POWER THIS FROM YOUR CAR!!!!

2/25/2020,2475-21XC,M12™ Compact Inflator kit,"Being that the inflator is 12 volt and I would think that a common use would be vehicle tires.  Since most vehicles have 12volt power available you would think that having an adapter to plug into the battery slot for power instead of having to rely solely on M12 batteries would be common sense.  
Other than that the inflator is good.  I do like the digital display and that you can set to a desired pressure to shutoff.  The price of the inflator is a little much for what it is, and I would like to see a longer than 3 year warranty for its price point.",3
2/25/2020,2475-21XC,M12™ Compact Inflator kit,"This thing probably works good for small car tires, bike tires, sports balls. For my dually truck not at all. It did take my 80psi front truck tires up from 65psi to 80psi, but it took about 20 minutes and drained a freshly charged M12 4.0 battery, per tire. You won’t be able to use this at all on rear dually tires where 1 valve stem points in and 1 points out since it doesn’t come with any type of attachment for dually tires. Even if you put an attachment on you wouldn’t be able to screw it on so you’d be stuck holding it on the tire for 20 minutes per tire and it isn’t quiet to listen to at all. You’d also need a 4.0 battery for each tire or between the 20 minutes to take a tire up just 15psi and waiting for the battery to recharge each time would take you all day. 

It’s Milwaukee though, so I’m sure an M18 version of this with a dually tire attachment and possibly even a small tank on it is already in the works. Had to take this M12 one back, its useless to me. Just hope the M18 one is going to be priced in reality.",3

I thought it might just be that I was using a small 2.0 battery so I got a 6.0 battery and it still did the same thing. I am disappointed in this Milwaukee tool which is a first for me, maybe it has its place but for me it’s not the best tool for the job",1

2/24/2020,2786-20,"M18 FUEL™ 9"" Cut-Off Saw w/ ONE-KEY™","I purchased the M18 9” Cut-Off Saw to cut a trench in the basement floor for an added bathroom. The saw’s performance exceeded my expectations. I found it to be lightweight, easy to set up, easy to use and the water hook-up worked very well. I would highly recommend this saw for smaller concrete and masonry projects, especially indoor projects where exhaust fumes from a gas powered saw would not be acceptable.",5
2/24/2020,48-11-1890,M18™ REDLITHIUM™ HIGH DEMAND™ 9.0 Battery Pack,"I have two of these 9.0 batteries, purchased separately a couple months apart (June 2018 time frame) with different Milwaukee tool kits. They have only been used for light residential projects and everyday tasks with various M18 tools (Impact wrench, leaf blower, string trimmer). Properly stored indoors, never stored fully drained of power, etc. Both batteries performed very well until recently.

A month ago, one of the 9.0 batteries that appeared fully charged suddenly failed to deliver power, hold a charge, or recharge. When put in the charger, status indicator light displays Steady Green. However, charge indicator displays a flashing single power bar. Allowed the battery to sit on the charge for 2+ hours, and 3 of 4 power bars are displayed on the battery's charge level indicator when removed from the charger. 10 seconds of use powering a tool, and all power is immediately drained. 

These 9.0 batteries do not seem to be reliable after a year or so of light use. Now I'm just waiting on my second M18 9.0 battery to fail in a similar fashion.",1

One full tree took one full 12ah battery that it came with and one fully charged 5ah battery which I already had. The 5ah battery was almost as strong but did not last nearly as long.  As far as the bar and chain system it’s an Oregon 16” R56  .043 3/8” chain which I picked up at farm and fleet for $15 as a spare but haven’t used it yet. It’s an easy on/off and adjustment for the bar and chain which I clean after every longer use. What I’d like to know/see is a sharpener like the Stihl chain has. 
It’s pricey but if it lasts as long as my old stihl then it will be worth the extra money spent to not have to deal with any gas!",4

2/24/2020,2707-20,"M18 FUEL™ HOLE HAWG® 1/2"" Right Angle Drill (Tool Only)","This is a typical Milwaukee battery tool - very well made and with good set of features. I was surprised at how little torque it will generate before the torque limiting device stops the drill dead.  I mostly drill in steel and every time a bit digs in even a little the tool stops dead.
Also, the trigger speed control is difficult to regulate at low and medium speeds.
I know that the torque limiting circuit is a safety feature, but I really miss my former Milwaukee 28 volt right angle drill which would go through anything without stalling (but required operator caution to avoid being spun around the room when the bit stalled !)",3
2/24/2020,2505-20,M12 FUEL™ Installation Drill/Driver,"I received an email from Milwaukee Tool asking if I’d post a review on the model #2505 Installation Drill Driver I recently purchased.  I initially hesitated because I had read dozens of reviews, and thought that others had pretty much covered everything (good and bad) that could be said about this tool.  I wasn’t sure I could add much new to the discussion.  Other reviewers said the up-top forward/reverse switch is awkward if you are used to the more typical slide switches AND you need to do a lot of forward/reverse switching for your work. That’s true but I don’t do much forward/reversing so it’s not a problem for me.  Other reviewers also pointed out if you use your third finger on the trigger and place your thumb and index fingers along the top edge of the motor housing you gain more precise control of the tool and can hit the reverse button with your thumb.  That’s also true, and worth the effort to learn if you don’t usually hold a drill/driver tool using that method.  Some reviewers complained their tool displayed run-out.  I don’t have that problem at all.

When reading other reviews, I didn’t see much said about the clutch and its excellent ability to be adjusted for delicately driving small machined screws.  The clutch has 16 adjustment levels of adjustment plus the full drill driver setting.  As a reference, when changing out old plastic electric outlet covers a clutch setting of 4 was perfect for tightening the small center screws without cracking the cover plate.   That leaves several lower settings for relatively more delicate work.  I really like the ability to precisely adjust the clutch down to very low torque settings on this tool. I feel the clutch is a major strength of the #2505.  This tool replaced an electric screwdriver I was using but it also has the power and torque to drill holes and drive larger wood screws without switching to a larger tool.

The #2505 is a high-quality tool for applications where lower torque and the ability to precisely control it is a necessity to protect delicate materials.   It fills the gap where an M18 tool is either too big or too powerful for the task.  This is my first M12 platform tool and I was pleasantly surprised with the power and solid feel of this relatively small tool.",5

Only had it for a few weeks and it has not failed me yet breaking loose the nuts and bolts I have put it on. Top heavy and a bit awkward in the out of position areas. Way better than running the nut or bolt out with a manual means. But get a good grip before you pull the paddle. It will smash some fingers when all that torque comes on.

3/8/2020,2485-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Right Angle Die Grinder",I use  this grinder regularly in my workship and it has perfromed extremely well so far.  It is especially handy to cut or gring something that a 41/2 inch grinder would be to large to use on.,5

3/7/2020,2504-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/2"" Hammer Drill (Tool Only)",Great little drill. 1/2 inch capacity in a powerful handy size. I have 18v drills and drivers but they are gathering dust because the M12 family is all I usually need.

3/7/2020,2743-20,M18 FUEL™ 15ga Finish Nailer (Tool Only),"PROS:
This milwaukee m18 (15g) finish nailer is nice to have to do alot of projects. Plus this cordless finish nailer is quiet. Run time is great on a 2.0ah battery.  Even better with 3.0ah compact battery. Don't really need to go run it with any larger batteries. It will get very heavy and you will get tired. No more air compressor and air hose to haul around.  

CONS
The design is awkward. The nail holder on the side, the tip is too bulky and when looking down you have to turn the gun to be straight.  I do like the design better on the DeWalt 15g angle nailer. Just don't care for that flywheel motor noise.  

I do hope milwaukee can redesign this model. Still a great nailer but you will need to change your habits on nailing with this gun.",4
3/8/2020,2520-20,M12 FUEL™ HACKZALL® Recip Saw (Tool Only),"It’s great to have on the lighter project. Times when you don’t need a heavier sawzall. I was on the ladder and had to cut into the soffit on a building and the M12 sawzall worked well glad I purchased it when I did

The issue: If you accidentally (or unknowingly as it was for me the first time around) leave the power switch in the ""on"" position the circuitry in the unit will drain the battery dead. An incredibly critical design flaw not to have a sense circuit to make it ""sleep"" when not in use. Which also means that you need to go in the back pocket of your jacket to shut it off at the end of the day or it will go dead. Imagine it your cordless drill did that.

For $60 I expected Quality long-lasting quality. When I purchased it has extremely happy when I realized I don't have to go through five modes of Lights each time I turn it on. Seems like every light out there now has so many modes but you have to go through each mode to get to the one you want every single time you turn it on. It drives me nuts. This Milwaukee you can set it on the mode, and you have a separate button to turn off and on. Had it for about 5 weeks now and I charge it daily as I use it daily. I went to plug it in the other night and within a few seconds it started flashing red and green. Didn't remember what that meant I figured it was completely drained or something.

 Also I take good care  of it by cleaning out canister and filter as instructed. The switch could be put in a better location also.

3/5/2020,2730-22,"M18 FUEL™ 6-1/2"" Circular Saw Kit","For the most part very very pleased with this tool. I have been a carpenter for over 25 years and have only had corded worm drives. However am disappointed with one feature and one flaw. The feature one is minor. The magnet that holds the blade change wrench is inadequate, allowing the wrench to fall of the saw easily. As a result I don’t keep the wrench on the saw. The flaw is one of poor craftsmanship I assume. When the shoe is perpendicular to the blade the bevel pointer reads 1 degrees on the bevel scale. The pointer is actually unable to read 0 on the scale unless the shoe is not perpendicular to the blade. Consequently, in order to make a 45 degree cut the bevel pointer must be set to 46 degrees, etc.. (I have made test cuts, measuring the results with engineering squares to rule out operator error) Since the bevel scale can’t be adjusted to relate properly to the bevel pointer the only remedy would be to file material off of the top of the bevel pointer, or live with always having to set the bevel 1 degree better than the desired cut. Otherwise happy with the saw, just expect better from Milwaukee.",5

The batteries retention gets lose over time and then the tool just quits, pull the trigger again, get three hits. dies. It's annoying. The rest of the tool has fared well in the dust filled environment of a tire shop.
I wish it didn't come in a blow mold case, its useless to me, if it worked with the stack-able storage system I wouldn't mind it, as it is the blow mold case just takes up space.

3/4/2020,48-22-8426,PACKOUT™ Rolling Tool Box,"Let me start by saying that while I am not a ""Milwaukee fanboy,"" I do appreciate the quality of products they're putting out. I own over a dozen different packout boxes, and handfuls of their M12 and M18 tools/batteries. I recently bought a second rolling toolbox though and this one HAS ISSUES. 
The lid (specifically the hinge) is the problem with this box. On the lid itself there is a small black tab that sticks out behind the hinge point in order to ""lock"" the lid in the 90-degree open position (straight upward). But this black tab is designed poorly and broke off on both hinges within the first 4 or 5 times of opening the box. I'm not sure if the tab sticks out too far and jams into the box body itself or if the tab is just made too thin, but now here I am, less than a month into owning my second rolling box and it's lid is already broken. I'm sadly disappointed in this box, the quality of the lid doesn't seem to match up with the quality of the rest of the box or the rest of the Packout line-up. 
Since this has happened, I have glanced at other Packout rolling tool boxes in HD stores while I've been getting other items, and I have noticed that several other boxes have the tabs broken on them as well and they haven't even been purchased yet. 
I'm not sure at what point things changed in the molding process or QC or what, but the first rolling toolbox I purchased almost 2 years ago hasn't had this issue as of yet. I'll continue to use this box, and the rest of the Packout system, however I'm disappointed that the toughest system on the market has such a weak point in it's main base box which you build off of.",2

3/4/2020,2111-21,USB Rechargeable Hard Hat Headlamp,"I use this headlamp caving in georgia and so far it's the only one that held up. It's very durable and takes bashing against rocks and withstands being sprayed with water. I love that the battery goes directly into the lamp and there is no power wire leading from an external battery pack that could get damaged. The light beam travels far on spotlight mode illuminating even relatively large rooms. The light beam is also very bright and wide and just the right color to really let you see what's around you. Some people complain about the battery life but for the light that is being produced I think it's completely normal. High mode hurts my eyes when I'm crawling around in tight spaces so there is usually no reason to turn the headlamp up unless I need to see something far away. Sometimes the lamp flashes red and green instead of charging but I found that removing the battery pack and putting it back in and closing it tight fixes this.

This tool seemed the best fit. I looked at the M18 5-6"" grinder because it has a quick stop feature and this grinder does not. But the reviews of that grinder were not great and this one had nothing but praise. In addition at the local box hardware store it felt for my uses that the bigger grinder was just a little too big for what I need. And to use a smaller cutting wheel would mean buying another smaller guard.
Angle grinders are dangerous as heck and I like having the paddle switch/lock so that I don't accidentally turn it on, yet it's easy to turn on and hold while working. And if I had an accident and dropped it, that it would shut off on it's own.
I like that this grinder works with a variety of M18 batteries which I already own and that as the batteries get bigger/better it will be easy to upgrade.",5

Weather it's removing rusty 1"" bolts from a 24"" pipe flange or pulling couplings with the 3 prong puller, its never lets me down.  The M18 impact also seems the most water tolerant cordless tool I have found.   In a paper mill water is everywhere and nothing is worse then your impact not working because water out of the flange your loosening causing the impact not to work.  I like these tools so much I purchased a kit for home. Milwaukee,keep up the good work and I'll keep putting your tools to the test.

The wide very stiff pockets make maneuvering around a bit hard at times, im sure this will improve over time though. I seen in another review that the tape measure clip pocket could be better. I would suggest having a finger pocket in the bottom so you can push the tape up rather than have to fit your fingers in to pull it out, small but big change.

I do not like too much torque, because on YouTube I saw the 3/8 or 1/2 inch converters get broken if the torque is too much, and do not need it either.

I am able to use my 1/2 stubby to remove cylinder head bolts, all the way to semi truck driveshafts, or even caging the brake chambers when needed. The settings on these stubbys allows you to finesse the power level for a more conservative amount of torque. This allows you to carefully install/remove smaller nuts and bolts without the worry of over fastening.

3/14/2020,2732-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 7-1/4"" Circular Saw Kit",Milwaukee finally cracked the code.

There's plenty of power to break most lug nuts. Where I use the Stubby to set the lug nuts and perform final torquing with a torque wrench. So can't attest to its tightening power. I can't say that for my use it's more than enough. For tightening large lag bolts and heavier drivetrain work I have the Milwaukee 3/8"" and Mid 1/2"" M-18 impact guns.

I hate to say it's almost fun to use now (maybe because I enjoy using my brand new cordless tools).  The power of this cordless tool feels like more than the corded version as claimed and the run time with the 5.0 ah battery is long...it's hard to say because when using it I could be cutting a few nails or sometimes cutting a door opening...two very different tasks but it does both well and the battery is sufficient to do both throughout the work day.

3/14/2020,2830-20,"M18 FUEL™ Rear Handle 7-1/4"" Circular Saw - Tool Only","Reviewed in the United States on March 2020

I have owned this saw for more than two weeks now using it on residential  projects. Facia, Sheeting, Framing, Fences. Running it on the 12.0 Milwaukee battery. I Only have to charge the battery once every 2-1/2 days or so. The saw weights 14.8-15 Lbs with the 12.0 battery.  This saw comes with a dust port attachment that can be removed with one screw and works good with my Craftman vacuum. There is a blade light on this saw and the cut marks can easily be seen from either side of the saw when cutting. The rafter hanger comes in handy when working on ladders or decks. No blade detents on the miter scale but I  do like those anyway. My only complaint is the miter table release lever. Sometimes it will spin itself out of its threads or become loose if you don't keep an eye on it. This can be very annoying when you are trying to work .Other then that it has been great. Having 15 amp power with no cord is awesome.",4

My wife does the landscaping maintenance around our property.  Did her a solid getting the M18 Hedge Trimmer! She loves it!!  Her comment: quiet, powerful and battery lasts longer than I do.  Bushes around the house that haven't been trimmed in years are now back at manageable levels.  Looks Good!!",5
3/14/2020,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),This blower has tons of power. It's great for removing leaf and grass clippings from landscaping even when they are wet.

It will remove lug nuts but I wouldn't use it for heavy use for extended use. I use the stubby in the tight areas where it's hard to get the bigger tools. It's good for brake jobs for removing caliper bolts. It doesn't have enough power for caliper bracket bolts for most vehicles but if you break them loose with a breaker bar first it still speeds up the process. It's also good for removing seat and seatbelt bolts that are loctited. This little impact punches well above it's size.,5

I have read through several reviews of the 2804 drill. I too have noticed the issues with the electronic clutch and the ""lockout"" issues. What I have not seem is any reply on the resolution of these issues. Are there any in the works or are we going to continually have to rebuild our previous generation model. The only reason this one was purchased was to replace my other that i had soaked on the job and it was quicker to buy a new one than to dry the old one out to finish the job. I have since dried the old one out and is back in service. The new one sits at home, mostly unused.

I look forward to seeing how Milwaukee chooses to resolve these deficiencies in this product.

But will do all 3 on each side at the same time. (So all 18v at the same time, then the 12v at the same time) we had 2 6ah and a 8ah 18v - and 2 3ah and a 1.5 12v. All from dead were totally charged in about an hour. We use this all the time. It has a pass through plug at the head side so you could plug 2 of these into one outlet, and not loose plugs (if you absolutely needed to plug something else in) great design and quality. It’s large, but not HUGE. It has to be able to comfortably fit 3 12ah 18v and whatever the largest 12v they are making now.

This tool is very good and plenty powerful for it's intended purpose.  The glaring issue I have found is that the offset drill head uses a magnet to hold the drill/driver and not a ball bearing collar.  This means the drill leaves the bit in the wood as I'm pulling it back out.  Also, I've had the driver bit get pulled out of the attachment after driving in a screw.  Not fun when you're up on a ladder and dropping items on finish pieces or co-workers.  I'd like to see this attachment updated and an option for us Gen 1 owners to swap out for the fixed version.",4

3/22/2020,2505-20,M12 FUEL™ Installation Drill/Driver,"I bought this product for the off-set hex chuck. (I already have many other tools that do 90-degree angles.) The best aspect of this chuck is drilling or driving closely into a corner. Regular chuck bodies are too wide to enable a hole that is  90-degrees to the flat surface AND close to an adjacent surface. The capability to rotate the chuck position enables getting the body of the drill out of the way in tight or awkward corners: very handy. The M12 power of the tool is OK (I prefer M18 torque & power), especially for household do-it-yourself (DIY) people, like me. The magnet on the handle is useful because I always pre-drill screw (or some nail) holes, therefore my most common the drill bit size stays with the tool. I found the reverse button awkward because I am used to, and prefer, the slide button near the trigger. The slide button enables one-handed change of direction, while the top button on the Installation Drill/Driver (IDD) requires the other hand to press it. One-handed operation is always preferred over two-handed operation.
Note: I rather have several drills in use at the same time than use a quick-change hex shank holder because the holders most often enable wobbling. The IDD is a superbly useful addition to my collection of drills, and fills a niche that no other drill (or brand) fills. Thank you for making the tool available!",5

While a corded grinder seems to have a bit more power/rpms that doesn’t make them superior. When using cutting discs with this cordless
Grinder It cuts very smooth and steady. When using a wire wheel on a corded grinder and you catch a edge it can feel like it’s gonna rip your hand off or go flying, with this cordless grinder it doesn’t grab and jerk nearly as much and makes it feel much safer. I pack this grinder around with me all day at work and use it far more often then I could imagine.

It is simply unbelievably thirsty for battery’s. Now I thought this would be the case so at the same time I also bought a high output 6 amp as recommended and with a Zip disk cutting 3/8 flat bar it was dead in under ten min.. now before this all I used was Xc 5 amp on a 1/2 inch high torque impact gun to do up 3/4 screen deck bolts and it is a monster!!

I never thought the battery powered reciprocating saw/hackzall would go head to head with the corded one as far as power.

Being light and compact means it won't sit on the shoe when you sit it down so get use to laying it on its face/back or it will roll over",4

It offers plenty enough power that I find myself never going for my mid-torque impact thats in the tool chest. 
My only gripe isn't a big deal, but you cannot use the regular m12 batteries to remove lug nuts. You have to use XC batteries, I didn't know that at first, but realized it when I couldn't loosen any lugs on any car with the reg 1.5 ah batteries, swapped in an XC 3.0 and it was night and day difference.

I can see electrical wires that are heating up or even if they are grounding to any metal before even touching it. Best use I have found is for boiler return lines that are burried underground and are leaking, it's just amazing how you can tell the difference between the area where there's a leak to where the pipe is fine.

Cause how it locks in, it get jammed up with dust so it doesn't slide easy and the tab they give you to grab is in a hole so it's not easy to put your hand in to grab in the first place.

Now those are the negatives.  Positives are you have up to four of your charge systems attached to the outside of that thing.

The cart is extremely durable it’s held 100 pound electric motors two 2 three of them with ease. The height of the cart is unmatched and I love the fact that it is that tall.  the computer table/whatever table works perfectly every time the pipe cut out is great and if you have to fit pipe.

3/18/2020,48-22-8900,Cut Level 1 Nitrile Dipped Gloves,"I don't know much about cut resistant gloves, but when looking at these gloves I noted that the images shows someone holding a box cutter to open a box.  I assumed the picture was showing what the gloves protect you against.  WRONG   I was using the gloves on a small project around the house and grabbed a box cutter to cut the strap off of bundle of lumber I had and the blade slipped off of the strap and ran across the front of my index finger.  I was barely applying any force to the blade when it ran across my finger but it still sliced right through the glove material........and some of my finger!

If someone from Milwaukee reads these reviews, would someone please reply and let me know if this glove is supposed to protect against a box cutter blade as one of your images sort of insinuates?

I ended up buying another brand cut 5 level to be safe and actually tested it with my box cutter and it did protect against a slice.  I guess lesson learned on my side!",1

However, they lack the strength to be very useful. It is hard to get any real tightness because they don't have a ratcheting system or some other mechanism that allows force to be maximized. They sit at the bottom of my clamp bin, unused and gathering dust the last couple of years. I think that says everything you need to know. Might be good for other projects that don't require as much clamping force.",2

I have a M12 sander/ polisher, and converted it to a 3"" wheel, and it has more power than this grinder. I bought two of them, and traded one in for a 1/2"" high torque impact.

Also fits a tig parts box perfectly in the other big zipper pocket. Fits my tig rig nicely in the very front open pocket. The backpack is made with quality materials all except the plastic buckles. They are fragile and break fairly easy (check the pics). This the only flaw and the reason it gets 3 stars. Milwaukee should really think about using steel instead of plastic because it can make this bag useless. I've tied the straps together to keep using this as a backpack. The rest of the backpack is awesome and an easy 5 stars if they can redesign the plastic buckles into steel or something not so fragile.",3

But this ratchet packs a punch when breaking away stubborn rusted bolts and nuts. Also when tighten up nuts and bolts, I like the way this ratchet stops when you let go of the button. Yes it is bulky and heavy but the breakaway torque and battery life is well worth it and I’ll say again helps with not getting a cramp or tired felling in your arms (Popeyes arms)",5

To make a long story short, forget about belt cutters, these thing goes through metal like butter! Tried to us a Dremel, but the 1 1/2” cutting discs were too small! The 3” cutting wheel is perfect! I can make 6-7 complete cuts with one Milwaukee brand “metal cut off wheel”. When I was using the competition’s product, it would chew through 3 or 4 cut off wheels, just to make one cut!!

3/28/2020,2711-20,M18 FUEL™ SUPER HAWG™ Right Angle Drill w/ QUIK-LOK™ (Tool Only),"I rated the product overall poor to ensure this is read.  Within the last three years I have completely replaced all of my DeWalt tools with Milwaukee, right down to the radio & heated gear.  M18 and M12. Thousands of dollars spent.  My most recent purchase one was this M18 super hawg right angle drill.  With over 15 years of experience in the HVAC trade I have always relied on my corded right angle drill for 4 inch whole saw penetrations.  With my biggest concern being wet rim joists and wet deck ledger boards destroying the battery powered drill.  So with my overall satisfaction for every Milwaukee tool I've owned being well above satisfactory I decided to purchase this cordless tool.  Thinking todays current technology and battery life would ensure its performance. I was wrong. On the first hole through a deck ledger the drill burned up and shut down making terrible noises.  Thank goodness the wholesaler this drill was purchased from, honored the purchase and just replaced the drill immediately. Verses myself contacting Milwaukee and going through the warranty process.  I do think overall it is a good drill. I just don't know if it should be advertised to handle a 6 inch whole saw when clearly a 4 inch is too much.

Thanks,

Mark",1

There's very little this can't handle. Having One Key and the ability to change output settings and trigger ramp is phenomenal. As for those who say that you can't use it for lugs torque, you're not using the app right. While it would be nice to have an estimated torque output instead of 20 power levels, it's not hard to estimate what you are putting out full speed. I've owned mine for two years, and have had no problems. One Key app was glitchy two years ago, but it seems they've fixed those issues. The protective boot is definitely worth it, I've got one on my 3/4 and wish I had put one on my 1/2 when it was new. Definitely worth the money",4

I bought the barrel rather than the D style because of its versatility to do coping. I use it all the time doing flooring, casing, baseboards, & coping crown moulding. It did take some ergonomic adjustment from the D style I've used for years. The fan that blows the dust away from the blade is the best feature! I no longer have to pause to blow debris away to see my marks. The dust tube fits great in the small M18 shop vac a co-worker owns, making cutting flooring much less messy.

I adjusted the power setting down until I get more accustomed to it. With sheetrock, you will definitely want to use a bit with a sheetrock bell so you don't go through the paper.

3/27/2020,2607-20,"M18™ Compact 1/2"" Hammer Drill/Driver (Tool Only)","I won this drill in a raffel.
- I like the smoothness of the chuck and motor. 
- The threaded inserts were handy.
--The hammer function is good enough.
- It's responsive and of acceptable power. 
- The tool has served its purpose well for metal work. I have this drill and a Ryobi P208B. That's why one lives in the shop and the other is in the tool bag.
This Milwaukee has subtle details that irritate me.
1: The switch for forward and reverse should stick out from the frame a bit more when depressed. Try it with welding gloves on, using your index finger, one handed, holding the tool in the air.
2: The light doesn't reach directly in front of the chuck. The Ryobi has the light on the bottom, and that's nicer for car work. But since the Ryobi chuck has .020"" runout, I have to use the Milwaukee. Put in a short cobalt drill bit and try to locate a punch mark under a car.
3: The drill won't stand up without a battery. It falls chuck first into the dirt and gets crunchy. Loses that lovely new-tool smoothness. 
4: No ceramic magnet is why I use this for metal work, but for carpentry, the Ryobi is in the tool bag.
5: Neither drill has a flat spot on the body. Sometimes, we need to clamp the tool to a flat object in order to drill a lot of dimensionally consistent holes.
-- This tool came with an M12 compatible charger. Does that enable me to use the M12 Fuel die grinder and cordless ratchet?  I generally like your tools. Hey, I'm a stockholder. But the refresh for your drill needs some tweaks.",3

3/26/2020,2488-21,M12™ Soldering Iron Kit,"I am a field electrician for a helicopter company and this is perfect for soldering applications where we can't get an extension cord to our work area.

3/26/2020,2402-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Hex 2-Speed Screwdriver (Tool Only)","For 12 volt tools, this is truly one of the best drivers a DIY guy could ask for. I don't do heavy duty all day, every day like some do, but I do some pretty decent size jobs on my home from time to time and this easily stands up to those tasks, especially if you are invested in the 12 volt battery system already. I'd recommend buying a 2nd battery, or get a bigger one with more juice if you are torquing a lot throughout the day.

Also, for smaller/hobby like tasks, it is perfect too. You can drill/screw very slow when needed, and work with delicate, finely threaded machine screws when required, but it still packs a punch and can run a 4"" hole saw in a pinch. These tasks will eat the battery quicker obviously, but I'm always surprised at how much power I get from this. The brushless technology is the key.

For comparison, I used to own some great Dewalt 12v lithium impact driver, and drill combo set, and I always thought that was the perfect combination of tools, and it was just a fantastic set of tools. They lasted a long time and I sold them to get into Milwaukee ecosystem. However, when I bought this I anticipated still buying an impact driver at some point, and maybe a hammer drill to give me 3 options for varying size and type of jobs, but this single driver pretty much replaced both my old impact and driver. This thing really can almost work as a light duty impact driver with the adjustable torque settings when it screw mode, and is a great drill too. It doesn't provide the impact torque you would get from a true impact driver, but unless your job requires lots of impact, I almost prefer this on most of the work I perform so I'm not over torquing fasteners. It's really probably the better option for most handy guys that aren't doing contractor work for a living. Ultimately it's considered their power ""screwdriver"", but I have come to view it as a nice hybrid between the two seemingly necessary power tools of impact and drilling since it can sort of handle both scenarios with a selector switch. You have drill mode, and then the screw mode with you can then apply a torque setting.

So if you don't want to buy two power tools, this will surely give you the balance you need. Now, if you are running deck screws all day, every day, then there is a better product, for you but if you are like me and your jobs vary and are all of the place, go with this you won't be disappointed.

My favorite features:

- The 2-speed selector is great, so when you need to rip machine screws out really fast you aren't waiting around, but then go to slower mode when you need to start a thread carefully, or make sure your wood screw is entering level.

- It's extremely compact/lightweight for the power it can output. It also feels awesome in your hand.

- When using 1 tool for everything, the hex chuck, quick change will speed your life up quite a bit if you are used to swapping between round shank drill bits and screwdriver bits. You have to buy hex shank drill bits, but to me it's well worth the investment once you realize how quickly you can jump between your bits. If you plan on using 2 tools to get a job done, this doesn't really apply as much but for me, hanging one lightweight tool on my belt that can do everything is really why this product shines.

Improvements that could be made (not much):

- I wish Milwaukee would design a bit ""holder"" attachment that fits this. They make them for some of the other drills and drivers. I would love to have 2 or 3 spots to slide a few bits on the side, because when you hang this thing off your belt you can just walk around and not have to carry much else if you have the bits you need. If you are listening Milwaukee, people on eBay are now 3D printing custom bit holders that can attach and are making their own solutions, but I'd still prefer a stronger, injection molded quality attachment from Milwaukee, maybe with some magnetic assistance. 

- The LED that lights up under the drill is a nice feature, but Dewalt did a better job here. Dewalt has 3 LED's in a circular pattern around the entire chuck, so I always had near perfect lighting on the work spot no matter what angle I was holding it. With Milwaukee's single LED positioned on the bottom, it's not as bright, and it can sometimes get blocked by the tool and create a shadow on your piece. Not the end of the world, but I noticed it right away when I switched. Maybe a future version will improve that. It would also be nice to toggle the light with a switch to stay on when inspecting in a tight area, as opposed to turning off on a time delay when the tool stops. Again, not a big deal at all but I figure I'd post what I think can improve the tool. If I'm complaining about the amount of LEDs and no bit holder, then I'd say we have a pretty good product here.

Finally, this is just my gripe about all Milwaukee 12V products - I really do not like the battery slide in and latch system on their 12V batteries, when compared to 18V. Also, Dewalt's 12V batteries are similar to the 18V slide and latch system, and I always was able to swap batteries with easy and speed on my Dewalt set. With Milwaukee, sometimes pressing the tabs together requires more force than you think to get the batteries out, and it seems to vary from battery to battery, tool to tool on the pressure required. I've had them pop out on their own when dropping the tool. Also, sliding them into the slot alwasy requires you to align it more slowly and carefully, unlike the 18V and Dewalt style slide batteries. It is so much easier to find the alignment on those styles. Again, somewhat of a minor gripe, but at this point I'm not sure they could convert all their 12v at this point since it would obsolete the battery connection system in place right now. Maybe an adapter could work but I am not sure it's even worth all that now. I guess it gives a reason to consider 18 volt products. In any case, buy this tool if you want the best 12v ""hybrid"" driver on the market, and in my opinion with regular use, it will probably hold up for 10+ years or more.",5

The fan does push air very strongly albeit some wind noise which I think is bearable. It does get noisy at higher speeds, however compensated with the very high output. Although the tool do not have any mounting hooks except the bottom screw mounts, a couple of bungee cords does wonders to get it mounted at the jobsite. The additioal ability to run corded with the included AC adapter is a plus point and I do appreciate that the transformer is on the adapter rather than within the fan case. If there is any issues with short circuits etc, I would then just replace the ac adapter rather than having to send the unit in for repairs. The power switch is solid and simple to operate. Maintaining it is also simple. It takes 6 torx screws to undo to remove the front grill which gives access to easily clean the insides as well as the fan blades. Features that I would like to see in future updates would be a set timer and brushless motor for more efficient operation and maximising performance overall.",5

Sometimes, having a cordless grinder is the difference of a couple of minutes to gain access to something vs. several hours. I'd used it a few times to cut rebar out from under a scooptram that got tangled up and I was more than excited to have it in my bag. I went to use it a few nights later to cut a 2' sch 40 pipe and it kept kicking out (with a brand new cut off wheel installed).

3/23/2020,2720-20,M18 FUEL™ SAWZALL® Reciprocating Saw (Tool Only),Great tool!!!! It’s cut through everything and is easy to use.,5
3/23/2020,2485-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Right Angle Die Grinder","This product is not cheap by any means, until you compare the money you aren't spending by not needing a compressor. This tool performed whether I used it with cut off, burr, wirebrush, or sanding discs. I feel great about this one for my Milwaukee arsinal.",5
4/5/2020,2522-20,"M12 FUEL™ 3"" Compact Cut Off Tool",So as a mechanic I'm always cutting old bolts or bent sheet metal even cutting access holes and this thing is small and can get in the tight spots but when it spins up you know 2 hang on . It's no joke will get the job done,5
4/5/2020,2746-21CT,M18 FUEL™ 18 Gauge Brad Nailer Kit,I bought two of the competitors and they both have failed in the first couple months. Since I got the fuel I have a brand new faith in cordless nailers. Clean nail is an accurate description and the balance doesn’t leave the arm fatigued at the end of the day. Love this piece.,5
4/5/2020,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),Wife loves cause she doesn't have to pull a recoil on one of our 5 Stihl string trimmers that get used daily for our lawn care business.,5
4/5/2020,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"I used this trimmer on our different shrubs and bushes. They actually worked incredible, they cut through like butter. even the thicker branches and limbs. And the battery was still three bars out of four..I would absolutely recommend these hedge trimmers. You wont be disappointed.",5
4/5/2020,2556-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Ratchet (Tool Only)","I’m an auto tech and I use this thing daily. Milwaukee has the best battery powered tools on the market, even better than the stuff on the tool trucks",5
4/5/2020,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I frequently blow leaves out of a carport. The blower works many times without a recharge. I may make a nozzle to focus the stream into a narrower area close the the pavement to get more distance on the leaves that I am moving.,4
4/5/2020,2530-20,"M12 FUEL™ 5-3/8"" Circular Saw (Tool Only)",Love the size of the saw. Run time is great. I don’t cut anything thicker than a 2x but still have my 18v just in case I do,5
4/5/2020,2108,ROVER™ Magnetic Flood Light,"The first Rover light I purchased did not stay illuminated; this also happened with the replacement flashlight. In reading the reviews Milwaukee is aware of this issue. Why inconvenience the consumer with this defect ?  discontinue selling the product until a
solution is found. Not fair.",1
4/5/2020,2475-21XC,M12™ Compact Inflator kit,"I use this product st home. It is fantastic. I love the feature of setting the pressure and it inflates to that pressure. I love the screw cap is metal. It is light and powerful.
There is absolutely nothing that I dislike about this inflator.",5
4/5/2020,2505-20,M12 FUEL™ Installation Drill/Driver,Love it. From fit to finish. It does what other drills can't,5
4/5/2020,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),"I just purchased this blower a couple weeks ago, and it works amazing! Bought it to use in the yard for leaves in the fall but wow does it ever blow snow off the walkways and vehicles!! Lots of power and the battery life is very good, I highly recommend this blower!",5
4/5/2020,2505-20,M12 FUEL™ Installation Drill/Driver,The different attachments come in handy in tight spaces. A lot of power in a compact tool. Extremely happy with this!,5
4/5/2020,48-22-4258,3/4 in. Mini Copper Tubing Cutte,"This is a nice tool and does the job it's intended to do.  The disappointing part is it's not made in USA and had I known that, I didn't because I ordered it online, I would've bought a different brand.  It would be be nice if Milwaukee would list where their tools are made on their website.",4
4/5/2020,2485-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Right Angle Die Grinder","I have used this tool three times in the last week. Grinding, sanding, and buffing are easy to do with the right angle tool. I am impressed with the battery life and power. It's not for heavy cleaning/grinding use, but is great for small to medium jobs. The size is great for mobile use or a tool box. The chuck still requires 2 wrenches to insert the 1/4 shank bit, but it is well spaced and easy to load and tighten. 
Overall a handy, well designed tool. I would not recommend it for heavy grinding, but for parts cleaning and general uses this tool fills the void.",5
4/5/2020,2475-20,M12™ Compact Inflator,"This is perfect for bicycle, motorcycle (& occasional use on car) tires. This is NOT designed for Continuous Duty use/made to inflate huge truck tires one after another! USE IT FOR 10 MIN then TURN IT OFF FOR AT LEAST 10MIN!",5
4/5/2020,2730-20,"M18 FUEL™ 6-1/2"" Circular Saw (Tool Only)",This thing works beatiful. The battery lasts a longtime for what i use it for.,5
4/5/2020,2726-20,M18 FUEL™ Hedge Trimmer (Tool Only),"Just around the house, easy. No cords and not enough to buy a gas trimmer.",5
4/5/2020,2746-21CT,M18 FUEL™ 18 Gauge Brad Nailer Kit,"Picked up two of these and they get used EVERYDAY!! Easy to adjust for perfect flush, little to no recoil, and loved that it came with two additional bumpers. Best one on the market!",5
4/5/2020,48-89-4631,Kit 23 PC TiN SHOCKWAVE™,3/8 bit broke after drilling 5 holes in obs plywood. Usually I am throughly impressed with milwaukee shockwave products but this one left me disappointed and frustrated. Would not recommend.,1
4/5/2020,2653-20,"M18 FUEL™ 1/4"" Hex Impact Driver (Tool Only)","Great upgrade from my former competitors tool. It's very powerful! 
Disappointed that if I'm using the 12AH battery that I can't get close enough to my work without the battery hindering progress. 
Also disappointed that the 1/4"" bits don't spring out into my hand, as my previous power tool did. To me it's not one-handed operation. 
Also disappointed that there is a short delay when I pull the trigger, as my previous power tool responded instantly with absolutely no delay. 
Other than these dissapointments, I love it!",4
4/5/2020,0850-20,M12™ Compact Vacuum (Bare Tool),It's good for household use and keeping your car clean.  It's not a deep clean tool but good for general cleaning/maintenance.  Definitely my most used Milwaukee tool!,4
4/5/2020,2804-20,M18 FUEL™ ½” Hammer Drill/Driver (Tool Only),They feel very well made and I love the ergonomics of them. So many options for add on tools. This won’t be my last purchase.,5
4/5/2020,2475-20,M12™ Compact Inflator,"Overall, I think that this inflator is a good product.  I purchased this as part of the Milwaukee M12 kit (miln2463-21rs) that inclused the Impact Wrench and a set of 3/8 metric socket set.
Just tried this out this morning to fill the tires in my wife's car.  I like the digital readout that provides current pressure and then you can set the desired fill to pressure.  Depressing the same ""check pressure"" button starts the compressor.  As my title expresses, this unit is loud.  I'm comparing this to my 12VDC corded VIAIR unit that is awesome by the way.  You can barely tell the VIAIR unit is running most times.  If you decide to buy this Milwaukee unit, just be prepared for it to be loud.  Functionality is great.  Just like most Milwaukee tools I own.",4
4/5/2020,2737-20,M18 FUEL™ D-Handle Jig Saw (Tool Only),"I use jigsaws every day at work laying flooring, this saw is the most powerful and precise saw I’ve ever used, I love it!",5

M18 is the best choice!",5
4/5/2020,2729-20,M18 FUEL™ Deep Cut Band Saw (Tool Only),"Milwaukee portable bandsaws are great to begin with, they have a great cutting depth for allowing you to cut larger materials especially with the adjustable shoe. The cordless model makes it 100% portable with out losing any essential power or cutting size. This is a must have tool especially in a high demand job with strict safety measures. This eliminates the miles of extension cords on construction sites.",5
4/5/2020,2732-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 7-1/4"" Circular Saw Kit","The M18 FUEL Circular saw is powerful with a long lasting charge allowing for many cuts on a charge. Tool is balanced, lightweight with a lighted guide. Very pleased with my choice.",5
4/5/2020,2722-21HD,M18 FUEL™ SUPER SAWZALL® Kit,Using this saw on one of the largest projects in Western Canada cutting 4x6 fir in -20 weather with no problem . A good choice for any professional that can't afford to switch tools,5
4/5/2020,2725-20,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer (Tool Only),I use it around the house the only thing i don’t like is the weed eater string head not being automatic feed,4
4/5/2020,2891-20,M18™/M12™ Wireless Jobsite Speaker,"Bought this from home depot. At first it worked perfect. Now it works when it wants to. Devices hook up fine but speaker output just fails . You can hear it trying to play then it just pops or clicks and no output. Sometimes if you turn it off for awhile it works again, other times not",1
4/5/2020,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","Used this product for cleaning trees on my property. lightweight, powerful and easy to use. I feel safe while using it, so quiet and not having to mess around with mixing fuel makes this a simple tool to use. I used multiple sizes of M18's depending on what I had fully charged at the time. 12.0 lasted the full 8 hr day of cutting and trimming pines, 9.0 lasted roughly 5-6 hours doing the same job. Milwaukee hit a grand slam with this tool. Definitely one of my go to favorites.",5
4/5/2020,2446-21XC,M12™  Cordless LITHIUM-ION Grease Gun Kit,I operate a Rocksaw that has over 40 zerks on it some that are hard to reach. The extra long hose it has on it makes it easy to pump grease in places where you can’t get 2 hands in. There are some zerks that an average grease gun won’t blow thru. This one has no problem!!!,5
4/5/2020,2781-20,"M18 FUEL™ 4-1/2"" / 5"" Grinder, Slide Switch Lock-On (Tool Only)",I had lots of modifications I needed to make to a house with a concrete foundation to get LVP flooring installed. Used the Milwaukee M18 angle grinder and it was easy. I was able to cut ½” corners where flooring could get closer to the Sheetrock with ease. Last use I had was making hold down slots for the kitchen sink in the concrete countertops. Overall would recommend to anyone and it is well worth the cost.,5
4/5/2020,2804-20,M18 FUEL™ ½” Hammer Drill/Driver (Tool Only),We like the ease of this tool works great. Good battery life which is very important to us.,5

But it is very unreliable, after a few months of limited use of two of these lights they will not hold a charge but for a few minutes at a time and then flash and cutoff.",1
4/5/2020,2485-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Right Angle Die Grinder",Great tool.  Used to use pneumatic version’s of this.  We bought one to test/try out. Now the whole crew has one.  I do recommend having/purchasing a high mAh battery like to 4.0 or 6.0 to use with this tool.,5

4/5/2020,2804-20,M18 FUEL™ ½” Hammer Drill/Driver (Tool Only),"I am a full time carpenter with a variety of tools.  Some days I am demoing a bathroom down to studs.  Installing drywall, paint, and tiling floor and walls of shower.  Other days I am trimming out a house. Installing doors, casing, base, and custom built in cabinets.  I have a lot of money invested in my tools .  I started with milwaukee pack out to help keep things organized and protected in my work truck.  They are durable and have held up. 
This made me start switching my tools over as well. I was replacing other manufacture drills every 6 months.  They fit nice in my hand and out perform some others , for example the hammer drill hits harder than others I have had in the past. 
 Only time will tell. So far, so good.",5
4/5/2020,2737-20,M18 FUEL™ D-Handle Jig Saw (Tool Only),This product works great I use it for work and make arts and craft projects with my daughter,5
4/5/2020,2804-20,M18 FUEL™ ½” Hammer Drill/Driver (Tool Only),"I use this tool almost everyday. My favorite character if this tool is its power and torque. Its relentless and I have yet had anything stop it. I am constantly using hole saws up to 3""  sometimes up to 25 holes at a time. This by far the best drill i have used yet. The Brushless Hammer drill is a game
 changer.",5
4/5/2020,2722-21HD,M18 FUEL™ SUPER SAWZALL® Kit,This saw all is awesome! It has tons of power and super high rpm allowing it to cut through anything super fast.

4/5/2020,2551-20,"M12 FUEL™ SURGE™ 1/4"" Hex Hydraulic Driver Bare Tool","I am an electrician. I bought this for use with smaller fasteners and tighter spaces. However, it also does very well with every fastener I've used it on including 3 inch construction torx screws. Seriously! This thing can drive a 3 inch torx and #10 x 2 inch sheet metal screw faster than my old M18 impact driver! And I find that it's much quieter too! The speed selection (Mode) switch is very useful as well. I can't find anything wrong with this 12V impact. I mean I could complain about not having enough power for the big stuff but that'd be splitting hairs since that's not what this was designed for and that's not why I bought it. It came with 2 M12 2.0 batteries and thus far battery life has been good. If I want more than I can buy a M12 6.0. But as of now I haven't had to go through 2 batteries in a single day. I usually make it through most of the day with just 1 battery. Overall I very much enjoy using this little impact. This does everything that I need it to. I see no use in buying the M18 Surge. I figured since this does what I want, I'd buy the regular M18 Fuel impact so I have more power when I need it. I just don't think anyone could go wrong with this impact driver as long as you use it correctly. It's a great tool!",5
4/5/2020,2485-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Right Angle Die Grinder","So far it's been a great addition to my Milwaukee tools. The size and comfort is great. Ability to use bigger mah batteries is a plus, unlike most brands. could use a touch more power but overall a really great tool. Thanks Milwaukee!!",5

4/5/2020,2551-20,"M12 FUEL™ SURGE™ 1/4"" Hex Hydraulic Driver Bare Tool","I use the m12  surge for light duty work. Its such a great tool to have when you're doing drywall repair ie. screw pop outs, cabinet door installs, removing and, replacing light fixtures etc. without vibrations or lots of noise. The down side to this unit.. is the 2.0 battery. this unit needs a 3.0 and better to give you longer work time. I use a 6.0 . Other than that I enjoy having it as my light duty go to tool",3

I am always very happy with my Milwaukee products, so I finally gave in and got this 6.5” circular saw. It’s great! 

I’ve got a 6 Ah and 3 Ah battery for it and they both work great.",5

I am a heavy equipment mechanic and the one who dose most of the welding and fabrication at my work. I use it from cutting bolts, grinding out cracks and cleaning paint and dirt off cutting edges. I use it almost every day. But recently a bearing on the armature failed. It went to growling  and not turning freely. I contacted Milwaukee and asked about the warranty and I soon learned that where I purchased it from Amazon the warranty is no longer good from Milwaukee. So now I'm back to a corded grinder and trying to get a bearing. So all in all I love this grinder when it's working and would like to have a couple more so I don't have to keep changing wheels for different tasks.",4

And the second thing is the clamp for the battery does not hold well enough to keep it tight and as a result The battery contacts wear out extremely quick.

4/4/2020,2485-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Right Angle Die Grinder","Used with a 3"" cutoff wheel attachment on 1/4"" arbor and used with 3"" grinding disk.  Works good but you can't put much pressure onto what you're cutting or grinding on . Small enough to get into fairly tight spots . Downfall is you need to keep several batteries with you because they don't last very long . Also the motor seems to have a binding or kickback brake and it will just stop running if you're trying to put much force behind it . Still good tool, think it needed more r&d before putting it in stores",4

It’s got all the torque needed to rear down the top end of an RD Mack truck, trans mission bell housing bolts, and it some cases head bolts in some automotive. Gets into tight places, comfortable to hold and very light. If Milwaukee come out with a stronger and smaller one I guarantee I will probably by it too. Great tool!!!",5

I do have a issue with this drill already the torque selector collar will get stuck in position and wont allow me to change to different settings. To get it unstuck i have to put in a screw that's already sunk into wood and try to drive screw further this unlocks the torque selector collar. Second issue is with the speed selector when changing from speed one to speed two the selector does not fully go to speed one or two no matter how hard I push to fix this I have to run the drill for a few seconds then It frees the selector and I can push all the way to speed one or two. Not sure if i would buy this again. Side note i noticed quite a bit of run out on this drill or chuck wobble.,2

I use a #2 square bit and #2 philips, the bit holder is almost useless. Holds only one bit, no magnet for screws. And won’t hold the Milwaukee Shockwave bits at all.

The studs have 1 1/2 crimp nuts and are very rusty. I was able to take six nuts off with one five amp hour battery. We have lots of battery’s in our shop, so I grabbed another one and removed the other four nuts with no problem. The fresher the battery the harder it hits. I 
usually use a 3/4 IR for this job. The socket got hotter quicker (more power) the gun got very hot but never tripped out for heat like some Iv seen. The gun pushed a lot of grease out of the cone. Hope I didn’t blow out the seal. For field work this gun is incredible!! It’s no big deal to carry extra battery's. Not as good as air in a shop setting but I am very happy with it!!",4

The bad:  not as powerful as one might think or wish for.  

This blower will work well for jobs that are limited or small in nature.  But if you have a large(r) yard or large job, you will spend more time on the job than with a gas powered or full size electric blower.    This is a nice tool but one needs to understand its limitations and purchase the right tool for the job at hand.  A good way to think about it is to compare a handheld cordless vacuum versus a traditional stand up, corded vacuum. You can essentially do the same job with both, but the time difference in how long it takes to do the job will substantially increase as the job size increases.",4

The M12 Surge has amazing power for its size. It’s actually a lot quieter as advertised too. The first setting slows down when it starts to sense some torque.

The battery is less than desirable because of the short lived usage life. That is 1 star. 
 However this may have been fixed since this was a battery from factory in mid 2018. 
Problem: does not charge beyond 3 bars (Green status on original charger). Then when I use it it dies within 60 seconds like it has no juice showing 1 blinking bar. 

The Good: Milwaukee cares up front for there customers but more importantly, believes in there products by giving this item a 3 year warranty, when purchased new/from authorized dealer.   The iffy: if the replacement sent is warranted for same number of years. Because darn it, if it dies shortly after receiving replacement based  by my usage/care.

I have used this tool almost exclusively to remove the motor and transmission, and the tool has handled almost everything that I have thrown at it.  The tool has the power to remove rusty fame bolts and lug nuts on full size pickups, as well as the compact size to access the hard to reach bolts underneath of a vehicle.  I have used the tool with assorted combinations of sockets (shallow and deep) as well as extensions and universals, and am yet to notice the tool struggling at all.  So far after pulling two complete motors and transmissions, I am yet to need to charge the battery.

This is not the high torque impact.  Through this project there have been a few scenarios such as rusted bumper mounts where the tool did not have the power to break the bolt loose, and I had to use an air wrench.  Overall though for its designed application this is a great tool and I highly recommend it to anyone who will be using it for automotive applications, and doesn't need the extreme power of this tools big brother.",5

It says not to spray flammable liquids such as gasoline.  The vitrol seals are specifically so you can spray chemicals.  It also advises against spraying acid and alkali, but everything is one or the other, so I take that prohibition to mean be careful at either end of the spectrum.  Even then, it only says that the tank and hose  MAY degrade and weaken.  As far as fire, it says don't immerse the system in corrosive or conductive fluids.

First, replace the electronic button for forward and reverse with a traditional thumb slide switch like every other drill / driver has. And second, make the hand-guard removable, so it can be there as a hand grip when you need it, but, when you need to get into tight places, it can be removed.

3/30/2020,0885-21HD,M18 FUEL 3-in-1 Backpack Vacuum Kit,"I was so excited when I ran across this vacuum after it first came on the market. How convenient would it make my life cleaning up after projects on the job when getting the corded vacuum was a pain.  I was quickly let down when using this for the first time.  It has barely average suction for a cordless vacuum, and this was brand new out of the box, as well as ever since.  I've done a good job at cleaning it and making sure there were no obstructions in the system to get the most out of it, and yet still mediocre at best.  I have a very large collection of FUEL products, and am obsessed with nearly all of them, so to fall this short on the mark with this vacuum, it's frustrating.  Especially after paying what it cost! The versatility of changing the batteries and the ease of putting on the straps and walking around are about the only things I enjoy with it.  I think Milwaukee is the absolute top dog for power tolls and the like, but leave the vacuums to the folks that do them regularly.  I would return it if I hadn't held out hope for so long that it might grow on me, so now I'm stuck with it.  If they could get the power that some of the cordless stick vacuums for household use have, and keep their platform of design and battery changing capabilities, I would have been blown away.  i guess I will just chalk this one up to an experimental buy I won't get any real satisfaction from unfortunately.  Big changes would need to be made to justify getting another one of these.  Good try though Milwaukee, I love my entire collection of tools, just not this one, and will continue to be a loyal and die hard Milwaukee customer.",3

I've had it for several years now and the extension arms and end brackets are terrible. The base is sturdy and that's nice, but the arms themselves when extended do not maintain alignment with base. The end brackets are flimsy and constantly need adjustment. At this point, they are both broke and fall off constantly. I've had to modify and remodify them multiple times now.

3/30/2020,2763-20,"M18 FUEL™ 1/2"" High Torque Impact Wrench with Friction Ring (Bare Tool)",This thing is tough. It has more power than what you think. I’m a diesel tech and so far the impact has broke loose more than what I expected it to do and be. And the 3/8 mid torque is beefy too. The only thing I don’t like is the placement of the forward and reverse switch. Sometimes I hit the button in awkward spots putting it in neural forward or reverse depending on angle at the time. Really needs to have some kind of buffer from where the top of your hand sits on the handle of the impact. But don’t let that stop you from buying this beast.,5

I've had no issues with charging, but it has recently took on a short. So, if you turn the switch on, you have to hold the focus ring. And as you move that ring light goes in and out. I'm a technician by trade. I looked at it, blew it ou t with air. I think I'm going to see if I can contact Milwaukee for warranty work. Anyway, great light. Mine has taken on that short but it gets worked. i.e. crawling under buildings, out in rain, etc. The light is pricey, but well worth it, if they honor my warranty issue.

4/11/2020,2555-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/2"" Stubby Impact Wrench","I use all my Milwaukee products in the off-road industry, and the stubby impacts come in perfect! My favorite feature is the 4th “auto” setting. A lot of Polaris SxS’s are held together by plastics and they use clips that shred easily. So the 10lbs of torque is perfect for not shredding the clips but also pulling all the plastics tight together. 

Both of my impacts are my go to’s for tightening up the roll cages as well. Each spot on the cage has it’s own torque value and the variable settings are awesome! 

Con: My one issue (not sure if it is even is an issue) is that occasionally during use I have to pump the trigger a couple times to get the impact to engage/start spinning.

I’ve had two co-workers buy the 3/8 and 1/2 impacts after showing them mine! THANKS GUYS!",5

It took down a 10 inch diameter tree with no problem at all.  This tool has great balance and super easy operation.  Two things to know:  1) It doesn't come with chain oil and 2) it does come with a chain tightening wrench. For my fellow DIY'ers, watch a YouTube video or two on how to judge if the chain is tight enough and then how to make the simple adjustment if needed.  My chain did not need tightening straight out of the box, but for safety sake, you should verify.  This is a great saw and I would buy again.",5

4/11/2020,2760-20,"M18 FUEL™ SURGE™ 1/4"" Hex Hydraulic Driver (Tool Only)","First thing I want to say is if you have long screws to drive in you need an impact, it's a game changer for those applications.

I’m so afraid to purchase another battery. I can’t invest more into a bad product. I’ve never had a problem with other brands. No way of charging this thing.

This hedge trimmer isn't too heavy and easy to maneuver. I pair with one of the M18 8.0 Ah high output batteries and one of those can easily take care of my yard with plenty of juice left over. It stores nicely as well with a slot on the back of the motor casing where you can easily hang it on the wall. Great product overall, I highly recommend it for homeowners.",5

Then milwaukee tool finally made the best metal cutting tool cordless no more draging out the cord anymore to make cut thanks kevin g.

It went out so I went to buy a new one and saw Milwaukee made one! It was nice  and grippy compared to my dewalt and it seemed slimmer. Bought it and the next day I was heavy gauge framing with 16 gauge steel studs and an opportunity came to use it. Put the hex head bit into it and put it in my impact and put in a hex head number 10 and pressed on it and it wouldn’t spin the screw!! it works fine for light gauge steel studs but nothing 20 or heavier!

I have put in solid wood trim and mdf and this puts the nails where you want them with a consistent depth without an air hose or compressor noise. No setup time aside from setting a test nail to make sure the finish depth is where I want it. This machine doesn't like partial strips (2 or three nails) but most 18g nails don't and if there is a jam it is easy to clear with a robust mechanism.

4/9/2020,2746-20,M18 FUEL™ 18 Gauge Brad Nailer,"This thing can fire nail after nail without any issue. The battery life is also incredible. But I have two major issues with this nailer:
1. I work with a lot of softwoods (pine and cedar) and the tip of the nailer (the safety release) consistently DENTS my wood. The safety tip takes quite a bit of force to unlock the nailer. On my softwood trims I end up leaving WAY more little dents than I ever did with my air nailer.

2. I shoot primarily 2"" 18g brads. This nailer consistently does NOT drive the nails all the way. If I don't push the nailer into the wall with a lot of my body weight then it will leave about 1/8"" of the end poking out. The problem here is when I DO push hard enough it freaking dents the wood! As a finishing carpenter working with softwoods, this nailer makes me choose between dents or protruding nail heads. This is obviously not okay. 

I gave it a 2 star because I'm impressed with the gun. For being battery powered, the thing is awesome. But these 2 flaws have me using my air gun again until someone can show me this has been fixed.",2

I use a diamond blade and proceeded to slice 2"" pipe with ease.  Grinder never stalled when I forced it into pipe that I was cutting.  It was a pain that tool is not available with the 7"" guards, but worth the extra effort to order them.",5

It would charge rapidly and be ready to go again in short order.  Now it only charges to 3 lights and lasts about 10 minutes in the blower.

Luckily the Milwaukee warranty is great and there was no issue getting a replacement.  However, this is the second drill(the other was an impact driver) that I've had to send in to have replaced/repaired in less than a year.  I think the M12/Mi8 line is great, and have purchased over $10000 in tools for work, but hopefully I don't have any more quality issues.",3

4/18/2020,2505-20,M12 FUEL™ Installation Drill/Driver,"So I originally purchased this tool after using Festool similar item. At that time, the only right angle attachments on the market for other brands (Milwaukee, Dewalt, Makita, etc...) left much to be desired. They were rather bulky additions, were hand held, and did not have a good locking mechanism (in my personal opinion). So the Festool was the best option...now step up to the Milwaukee installer drill with the 4 interchangeable heads... well built, easy to use and interchange, an m12 compact size that allows for light and hard to reach uses- with the unexpected power of the fuel brand when needed. With my 6.0 red lithium battery, I have 1 bag to take to almost any install. 1 bag is all you need. Sorry Festool, Milwaukee gets my money, AGAIN. Team Red.",5
4/18/2020,2505-20,M12 FUEL™ Installation Drill/Driver,I did not realize how much I would use this tool and its various attachment heads till I had it.

The surge from day one would stop halfway thru installing a screw, it was a 50/50 chance it would drive the screw all the way.  I have a gen3 fuel impact that just zips thru these but is in the repair shop getting alot of things replaced.  I bought the surge bc i was interested in it and needed something to get me thru till I get my gen 3 back.  I tried various batteries, i have a total of 8 that i tried and no matter what the surge seemed to just shut off part way thru driving.  I ended up returning it and buying a 2850 impact to get me thru till i get my gen 3 back.

However, this new blower actually blows the old one away.  I used to be unable to blow leafs across my driveway when my truck was parked on it.  With the M18 FUEL Blower it clears not only leaves, but all other debris that was in my driveway and even clears items under the truck without me having to walk around it several times to get it cleaned.  Excellent product.  Only drawback is, that I wished the battery would last longer on high speed.  But having said that, I would definitely buy this again.  Just go get it.",5

I bought it thinking that when they said it would charge a HO 12.0 battery in only 1 hr and it's 2X faster at charging than the Rapid Charger is, that it would also be 2X as fast at charging ALL of my M18 and M12 batteries compared to the 2 Rapid Chargers I recently bought......but NO! It's the EXACT SAME CHARGE TIMES AS THE RAPID CHARGER for all the M18 and M12 batteries that are NOT High Output rated! This is way too much money for a charger that only seems to benefit 3 batteries in their lineup, if I had known this fact BEFORE wasting time waiting in a lonnng line at HD to buy it, I would have stayed home and ordered the 6 port (3-M12 & 3-M18) Rapid Charger for almost the same money!",3
4/16/2020,2739-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 12"" Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw - Kit","Pros: It’s exactly what I needed and was looking for. It’s cordless, has a 12” blade, and cuts everything I need it to. Its not exactly corded powerful but all I have to do is slow my cut a little and it’s almost the same. The shadow light is my favorite feature. Dust collection bag is the best I’ve ever used. Blade stop is awesome and it’s relatively quiet compared to some of my old saws.

Neutral: This thing can be a beast to carry, especially if you have it mounted to the base attachments for the saw stand but it’s also heavy duty and well built so it’s a good trade. 
This thing is expensive A F, but I love Milwaukee tools. Buy once cry one though.

Cons: Would be nice to have an option to plug it in but Milwaukee wants us to buy their super expensive batteries! Lol.
Horrible assembly instructions. Mine had pictures that were inaccurate and in such terrible detail that people without mechanical aptitude or knowledge of miter saws might struggle. I also wish they offered tool packages that made more sense like the saw and stand instead of a saw and a jig saw. The only combos I saw that made somewhat more sense with with the saws smaller than 12” which is a bummer.",5

They are very nice safety glasses and fit excellent but they just fog up so quickly and all the time so I’m constantly having to remove them to let air hit them to un-fog. Now it’s even worse with this covid-19 virus because they are making us all wear mask since we’re on union job sites so all your breathing goes straight up into the glasses and fog up constantly. Now they’re very strict about having your PPE on so it hard to take off your glasses so they can un-fog. I recommended  them to all my co-workers and they all bought some but now I have to hear about them fogging up all the time. I’m still going to keep buying them tho because I support Milwaukee!!!,2

4/16/2020,2730-20,"M18 FUEL™ 6-1/2"" Circular Saw (Tool Only)","This is my first cordless so my only reference is cheap corded saws. The most noticeable characteristic of this saw is how quiet it is. All other corded saws I've used (admittedly 10+ years old) are loud enough to need earplugs. Unless I'm cutting really dense wood the noise is tolerable. With 2 5.0Ah batteries it will cut pretty much non-stop with one sitting on the charger. The blade brake is also REALLY nice; if you're doing a long rip on some knotty wood and the blade gets squirrelly you can just release the trigger and it stops almost instantaneously. It can still kick back if you're not paying attention, but all other saws I've used take a few seconds to wind down making it harder to get out of a kickback situation. Very nice feature.

As other reviewers have mentioned, this saw has a couple of silly shortcomings. First, no rip fence included, seriously? Now I often find a rip fence gets in the way and tend to remove it for most cuts, but there are times it is handy. All saws I've ever used/owned came with one, strange that a high-end saw like this one doesn't. The hex wrench for changing the blade also sits loosely in a hole on the side with no magnet or a clip to hold it in place, so it just falls right out. Again another silly oversight on what is otherwise a pretty decent saw.",4

I don't use this often but when I need it, I want it to work as it should. I've owned other palm sanders and used them up, thinking this would live up to the Milwaukee reputation of my other tools. This does not, it is not worth buying again.

4/14/2020,48-22-8540,40” 6-Drawer Mobile Work Station w/ Stainless Steel Top,"Everything about this work station feels very heavy duty.  

The Box:  The sides of the box are thick and are extremely rigid.  Each side includes threaded inserts for the included accessories, with additional inserts for future upgrades. 
 The stainless steel top is exactly what I needed for my use and there is no flex at all.  The weight of the box and density of the top allow it to absorb impact with no springiness.  I have already rebuilt various pumps and a small 4 cycle engine with complete satisfaction.

The Drawers:  I have already loaded this chest with sockets, wrenches, air tools, various pliers, M18 tools and ratchets.  Even with a full compliment of impact sockets and air tools in one drawer alone, it glides smoothly, shows no sag or stress under the weight of it's contents.  The drawers guides are angled slightly back and down, so the drawers remain level, but naturally float back when left open, which is perfect for someone like me who carelessly leaves drawers open all the time.

Casters:  I'm not sure of the exact weight of all my tools placed in this box, but I'm confident I have met or exceeded recommended capacity and the box still rolls effortlessly  and when locked, the box does not wobble like my other tool chests.

Although this box is for home use, I restore vintage hand tools and machines, restore vehicles, and am very deep in a major home remodel, so I needed something that could easily move around, hold my tools, and a top that can take abuse, all while still looking good enough to impress my friends.  This box has been nothing short of impressive thus far and truly lives up to it's namesake.  Though I have only owned it for a few months now, I would not be surprised if this chest lasts my lifetime and beyond.

Pro:
1. CFM is great 
2. Size 
3. Fit and finish is excellent. 

Con”s:
1. Only one speed means it drains batteries in a minute 
2. Did they even build a prototype? Why would you put the switch behind your hand out of reach? The hose is tight such that you carry it with the hose pointing forward. Also so the blowing exhaust is behind you. That puts the on off switch behind you. 
3. While its stackable, it isn’t as functional as you’d like. You have to stop, open two latches, get out the hose and attachment. Close and secure two latches. Turn it on before you pick it up.

I've used it about six times (Its so big I don't use it on my drill/driver, but on my weed eater and leaf blower). It looks brand new. Its completely dead. The charger won't even try to charge it.  The worst part though is that for some reason this battery is exempt from Milwaukee's eservice program.

I carry my fastback when I go to work every day and use it often sharpenIng carpentry pencils, cutting boxes open, and other random construction stuff. The clip redesign is way better and they included a blade button release guard as well as moved the release button on the other side of the blade.
Now the bad. The first thing I noticed was the blade holder is loose and Isnn't holding it's self closed. It makes the knife feel cheap and broken. Also you can't open the blade holder of the blade is closed. I like to keep the blade closed and replace the used blades I've collected with new ones. The second thing I didn't like is this new knife doesn't have a 45° stop like my old one. My 48-22-1903 fastback can lock open at 45° for more forceful cutting, and the blade holder is stays closed! 
I thought about returning the knife but I didn't want to go through the hassle so now I'm just going to forget about it and throw it in the toolbox for emergency knife uses.",2

I have actually made it past the 5 year warranty period with some serious use out of this drill. I say this as I have killed numerous high end corded drills over the years and this thing replaced them. Honestly, it wasn't my first choice back in 2014 when I picked it up, but it was in stock. After realizing this thing had more than enough power, even more than some of my corded drills, I stuck with and have never looked back. I use this drill for about everything imaginable from drilling, driving and to starting small engines. While the impact does work better for sinking large fasteners Ill reach for this just as often. The drill is not without it's flaws, however, these problems are only a small nuisance and have only began to present themselves. I freely admit I'm not gentle on tools what so ever, from accidentally dropping them, to putting them through there paces without brakes...9.0 life, and forgetting them outside in the elements. The first nuisance that presented itself is that the chuck occasionally gets stuck shut resulting in the use of some channel locks to brake er free. A lil bit of lube, wd40 usually sorts this problem right out. Second, the fan literally grenaded itself out the back of this thing, but besides from running a little hotter than it already did, it's still working. Third, she likes to get stuck in gear, no problem however as long as a screw driver and hammer are present. I also don't change the gear much into low gear, which is probably the reason for it getting stuck. And believe it or not that's all. The trigger still works flawlessly along with the forward/reverse switch, and the clutch system all function. I'm still using the drill to this day and I'm honestly curious how much longer the brushes, or the drill will last.",5

I did buy extra batteries (do not waste your time on non-Milwaukee batteries) and for my suburban lot it is perfect.  Except for the winding head.  It is a great idea but just doesn't work well enough especially for the older operator.  Plastic does not turn easily on plastic and there is no way to lock the head while you are turning so you are depending on hand strength alone.  However, you an just take the fancy head apart and wind the line by hand and then stick it back together.  It works but is not as slick as the original design.  Maybe Milwaukee might want to run this by engineering again.",3

When I have the speed set to 2 and am using it for drilling, every time I release the trigger the forward/reverse pushbutton moves enough to lock the trigger out. When I release the trigger it becomes jammed and I need to push the forward/reverse button back all the way to the forward position before it will allow me to press the trigger in again.

When I found the Milwaukee flash light I was impressed with its powerful beam and thought it was worth the expense. Unfortunately the battery kept running out after a very short period of time whilst having been fully charged. I tried several times to Charge it and reuse it but it kept letting me down at the most inadequate times like when I was in a crawlspace. It finally just stopped working and has been sitting in my truck for the last 6 months. Today I decided to leave a review since I had a little extra time on my hands.

I've worked automotive and more recently heavy duty with it as my main and only large impact gun for all these years without any issues.
I use the 9.0aH high demand battery and it lasts a long time. However despite what Milwaukee claims the tool does actually hit harder with a bigger battery.
I love this gun it beats out most of the half inch pneumatic guns around the shop and it's a lot faster in the process.

4/23/2020,2132-20,M12™ ROCKET™ Dual Power Tower Light,"I used this light maybe 7 or 8 times over the course of a year. It lights up a work area very nice. However, the design of the cable may be faulty - not sure if anyone else has had this problem, but the cable is essentially a phone cable, it's coiled up around a plastic rod. It allows the telescoping of the light pole. However, on my light the cable became twisted inside, the way a phone cable often does. This caused the cable to be pinned on the plastic rod inside of the pole, making it so I can no longer raise and lower it. I took it apart and attempted to repair the cable, which worked one time and it's stuck again. It would be really nice if it worked the way it was designed!",1

So far I have been happy with my equipment. I usually run circles around my co workers and their ""Yellow"" tools. I purchased several pieces of equipment with the 9.0 batteries so I now have 3 in total. I use my 5.0 batteries almost exclusively because they seam to last longer. One of my 9.0 would charge and discharge very quickly, within minutes of use. Now it will not even charge. The lights will flash red and green on the charger. I have a second battery which is starting to show the same fast charge and discharge symptoms. The third is currently holding at the moment, but all three batteries have minimal use. The two batteries that currently work have become backup batteries only. Very disappointed that the quality I have come to expect from Milwaukee tools is missing on this particular product line. It seems to be problematic and needs to be addressed. I have too much money invested in my tools to change them out and have been pleased with performance for the most part, but I will not purchase or recommend the 9.0 battery.",1

I really like the design they are also lightweight so 1 star for that. The 2nd star is for the rubber nose pad I really like that feature helps keep them in place. Main reason that I purchased these were for the anti fog and scratch resistant features. Unfortunately on both pairs this was not the case they scratched and fogged up like they were any other throw away $5 dollar glasses. I was hopeful when I bought the second pair only to be disappointed again.  Also there is currently no replacement lenses or nose pads so that nice milwaukee frame straight to the trash.

When I was finally able to get it, man it was awesome. No more busting my knuckles, wearing down my discs from awkward angles. The only real issue seems ridiculous but has actually proven to be a pain in the butt. The magnets keep falling out of the attachments. So if I don't hold the tool upright my arbor falls out into the engine compartment. That pesky little piece has actually fallen out of 3 of the attachments. I keep hunting them down and trying to reglue them in but have not been able to. And also would not be as big of a deal if it was an isolated incident, but my work truck was broken into the week before Christmas and 2/3rds of my packout was stolen with about $8,000 worth of Milwaukee tools were taken. Soo since I have been replacing what I can when I can. There has been a lot of little things and not so little things. Like brand new battery that is bad, on my rocket light with just a few uses the locking clasp on the neck broke, also bought the 1"" impact and it does not deliver the power that it claims.

5/3/2020,48-22-0125,Compact Tape Measures,"I've gone through two of these tapes in a little over 6 weeks.  I am on my third one, and if it happens to this one, I will not be buying another one, and will look at another brand.
The tip, or should I say the first two to two and a half feet of the tape twists.  Then the hook will not stay on the end of the board or wall, etc. of what it is that I am trying to measure or lay out.  I have read a few other reviews on some of the other tapes you make, like the Wide/Stud/Magnetic etc., and see this is an issue across the board.  I read on a few other boards, as well as was talking to another contractor that told me he thinks it may be from the tape reeling in too fast and slamming the hook/tip into the housing.  But when I was a young boy, I learned that you keep my finger on the bottom of the tape when it is reeling in, and stopping it well before it hits the housing.
I have posted a review on my Instagram and soon on my YouTube channel.
So since this is my second one, I will give this brand and model a third chance.  I may go to a wide tape, but I don't like them.  They are not only too heavy, but they are too wide for the tape pocket on my tool belt, plus, they get caught on studs or other tight places if the tape is hooked on the side of my pants.  So a normal sized tape measure case is needed.  If the quality of these tapes is the same as an old timey Stanley steel case, then I may go back to one of those, and save myself a lot of money.  Yes, they are cheaply made, but they last just as long as one of these.  Or maybe a DeWalt may be in my future.  I would rather pay for a quality brand that I know and trust though.  So Milwaukee, take a look at these reviews and make the appropriate changes.",1

We had a Craftsman hammer drill but it was pretty much useless as it bounced all over and made hole too big plus took 5-10 minutes or longer to drill one hole in concrete. So we went online and the reviews stated the best hammer drill was the top line Dewalt. We bought it and it still took a long time to drill one 5/8” hole and also bounced too much and went bad after 9 not very deep or good holes that took what seemed like hours and exhausting vibrations. Then my soon read online about rotary hammer tools. We watched a few YouTube videos and I ordered this unit hoping it would not take days to do my final 30 plus holes. What a shock! Drilled holes super deep with 5/8” bit in about 30-40 seconds and we had the job done in about an hour! What an incredible tool. And since we already had M18 tools and batteries this has been a great add-on to our tool box! WOW!,5

5/1/2020,2503-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/2"" Drill Driver (Tool Only)","The E-Clutch is a good idea to slowly start a screw that has only an indentation from a center punch, or no indentation at all. But the drill torque on the lowest setting still strips all screws if you are not very, very careful.

FUTURE SOLUTION?
Yet here is my suggestion. First, the E-Clutch slow start (when you press the trigger) is only for starting screws so it doesn't walk on you, correct?  Hence, there should be just a separate ""slow start"" button for a ONE-TIME slow drill start to start a screw when you press the trigger. After, the drill turns 1 or 2 rotations the slow start goes away and the chosen torque setting is electonically enabled. Thus, you still get a torque control after the screw is started and near the end of the driving of the screw.

This ""slow start"" button is a ONCE PER TRIGGER enablement. That means you have to again press the this ""slow start"" button for the next slow start before you hit the trigger. 

If you don't hit this slow start button, the trigger will automatically always choose the chosen torque setting and the drill  will  NOT do a slow start just like the traditional cordless drills by Milwaukee.

Hope this makes sense as there is essentially no torque control with this E-clutch drill as it is designed right now.",1

I was expecting an upgrade since it has 4 speakers, a sub, and newer technology. I was hopeful it'd be louder then my jobsite radio, not the case! Sounds more like a downgraded, especially when turned up over half. It's very tinny even with the treble turned downed and the sub is either over powering or non existent.

I gave it a rest and went back to a corded version, then after an hour I tried it again and it started smoking like crazy and made terrible growling sounds. I didn't use excessive pressure and ran it for no more than 20 minutes before it started acting up. I just ordered the 9"" heavy duty fuel version and it better work better than this!",3

4/28/2020,2485-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/4"" Right Angle Die Grinder",I am not a mechanic or use this die grinder for my work. I was hoping for a grinder that was easy to handle to knock some rust off of some stuff around the house and sharpen my shovels etc. I was about to go to HD and purchase 2 new batteries because was experiencing the same problems of the tool stopping either with a light load or just running up to speed (even on 1st speed). I am glad i read the reviews first. It is very frustrating when you buy a tool and think that is an issue with your tools and not the new product. I would recommend any of Milwaukee's product just not this one.,1

Happy with it so far. I've used it for numerous jobs, but the most use has been from my kids.  They have been cutting a trail for their 90cc atv through the woods behind the house.

The first one, changed my life.  I absolutely loved it but it recently quit working so I got the new second generation model to replace it.  The new one was considerably faster in high gear ( which is what I always use).  It worked great for the first 10 holes or so,  until I got to a board with a knot in it.  When it was too much for the drill it cut out but not like my old one used to.  It starts to run again when I try it without touching the wood but it just slowly spins a rotation or two and cuts out again.  It keeps doing this until I let it rest 10 or twenty seconds.  This is frustrating and this seems to happen a  lot.  The other problem I have with it is with the quick lock chuck.  When using Milwaukee extensions, They get jammed and I have to hit the quick lock with my hammer to get it to release the extension.  I was going to take it to the  Milwaukee store to have it looked at but they are closed because of the corona virus.  I sent an email to Milwaukee about it and it took a while but they finally responded.  They suggested that I mail it to them to be looked at.  I am hopeful that they can fix these two things but if they can't and if both are just issues that are common with the second generation drill, I can't recommend it.  I would look for a first generation drill if they are still available.",3

Just in the past 3 years alone I have spent thousands on new milwaukee tools, batteries and accessories.

So, that why I am so disappointed in this sander. 

Overall the sander is Milwaukee quality, it gives great battery life and does the job very well.....but then we come to the dust collector. 

When I first got the sander, I thought it was funny how insanely tight the lid to the bin was on, then I got on the job site. Half the time you can't get it off and the other times it comes off on it's own. If you have ever had a full dust collector come off while standing on top of a 13 foot ladder sanding drywall, then you know how frustrated i was.

The bin itself doesn't even stay attached to the sander, most of the time it just slides right off.....It is so poorly designed that I stopped using it all together and I just duct tape a vaccum to the exit hole

Because of this sander I don't instantly think of Milwaukee anymore. I doubt I will switch brands, but I am hesitant to get anything else,.",2

I have tossed the chain so many times I'm starting to avoid using it.  I used the included scrench to adjust the bar tight as I can.  I even use enough force to tighten the two bar holding nuts down that I'm nervous I'm going to break it.  Sure enough not even by the end of the 12 ah battery I'll throw a chain and repeat the process.

super powerful light, small enough to easily fit you pocket, simple to use.
The Bad...
Horrible battery life, I might get an hour of use before it needs to be recharged. the cost for a replacement battery is rather steep. 
The Micro-USB cable is sub-par, I am a computer tech and I was disappointing is how fast this cable joined the cable graveyard.
Magnets, one magnet is great, but the horizontal magnet cannot even hold itself in any way. I gave it many tries, but after getting hit in the head, or it falling to the floor I gave up on that magnet. This does make it only 1/2 as useful as it could be.

Overall, I am not sure I could with good conscience recommend this product until Milwaukee made some tweaks to this product. I feel that this could be a wonderful flash light/flood light. I hope Milwaukee makes changes for future buyers, because at the price point there are definitely some deficiencies.",2

Why did they sell me the other four sizes? I'll never be able to use them... Plus, because I can't get the adapter off, I can't even put the two-incher back in the case.

4/28/2020,2722-21HD,M18 FUEL™ SUPER SAWZALL® Kit,"The Super Sawzall was ordered online from the big orange box store and arrived quickly. 
Immediately upon picking up the tool you will realize that you have a quality heavy duty tool. This is the only downfall of the tool, the weight. In order to be heavy duty and be able to tear through materials like it does the weight is a small trade off for the power you have. The battery run times are appropriate compared to other battery tools. It is obvious the 12ah battery is the one to reach for if there is a need for power cutting and run time. The goes back to the weight of the tool. In order to have max run time you have to add the heaviest battery in the Milwaukee line up. 
If you need a saw that is built to cut this is it. If you need a saw that runs a long time without a cord this is it. If you need a saw that you can count on to run and not shut itself off due to overheating this is it. If you want a featherweight saw, look somewhere else.",5

5/7/2020,49-22-4009,9 Pc General Purpose HOLE DOZER™ Hole Saw Kit,"Short of screwing the saw onto the mandrel the kit comes preassembled. Of course the bigger saws have the bushing to adapt them to the mandrel and even it’s washer is already attached. Easy Peasy. Even if you separated everything individually they’re sized to match and they only go together one way. (If in the correct order!) Saws did a great job. Gave me a smooth finish with a fast cut. I’d place it in the heavy diy to light professional category. And the case is a huge plus if you’re prone to misplacing things. :-)
The kit comes with an Allen wrench for the pilot. Common wrenches will disassemble any overtightening. The saws are even still unscrewed from the mandrel with the age old design of a screwdriver through the slots.
If you don’t have any experience with tools a quick google or YouTube search will answer most problems. The only neg retailer reviews I saw (Very orange website) indicated those hole saws had been misused/mistreated/misassembled or user had no understanding of how it attaches to a drill (I’m not exaggerating). Hole saws are completely safe if used as designed. Hire a professional if you won’t put forth the effort to educate yourself. You most likely will get hurt. People, You are the only one who can be responsible for proper use and your own safety.
I thoroughly recommend this kit. There’s always the occasional manufacturing defect, but Milwaukee has never failed me to stand behind their products. For my use it goes above and beyond what I paid for it.",5
5/7/2020,2505-20,M12 FUEL™ Installation Drill/Driver,I purchased this to keep around my house as all my other tools are in construction trailer. I was surprised how powerful the 12v driver was.

Not for the heavy-duty jobs but works great for the smaller stuff.,5

They where corded and was a pain to drag 4 to or more cords around.  An as far as other tools what can I say pull trigger work no pulling at cord praying machine will start.

5/9/2020,2653-20,"M18 FUEL™ 1/4"" Hex Impact Driver (Tool Only)","Overall construction seems top notch. The batteries last forever. The torque is more than adequate. However, I did snap the head right off of a Milwaukee shockwave
 3/8's drive adapter when using it normally. And this happened within the first week of using it. Those shockwave bits do have a odd section that is turned down quite a bit, but that might be so THEY snap and not the bolt your tightening. I would never sacrifice quality in the effort to prevent stupid. Anyhow back to the driver. The couple flaws I've noticed. 1. It's really quick to ""amp out"" so to speak. If you repeatedly tap the trigger it seems to very easily go into a protect mode. Where when you pull the trigger it does nothing till you let it go and try again. Little annoying but I can get used to it. 2. The bit holder is absolute garbage. It doesn't hold a single bit in the entire shockwave set I bought with the driver. I mean the bit holder might as well not even be on the thing. It's horrible. Overall though, the Milwaukee seems very well built and tough. Hopefully it handles grease and grime good and also the cleaning afterwords. I use it in equipment manufacturing so only time will tell.",4
5/9/2020,2737-20,M18 FUEL™ D-Handle Jig Saw (Tool Only),Main purpose was to eliminate the cord and possiblity of cutting the Jigsaw cord. I had a cheaper jigsaw I got used to barely go through anything and would struggle to make turns. The Milwaukee and just the 1 blade it came with made about 20 outlet cuts like a knife through butter. The trigger is variable also which was nice to slow down towards the end of the cuts.

Most often the battery is more than half full.   Use the low speed for inside the garage and works great.  What I really like is the lightweight design and the balance it has with the battery installed.  Not hard on the wrist at all.  The trigger lock feature is great if you have to use it on a big portion.  There is a hole on the back to hang on the wall also.  People say it really quiet but it is just as noisy as my old electric one, but nothing like the gas powered ones.",5
5/9/2020,2724-20,M18 FUEL™ Blower (Tool Only),I use the blower to cleanup the garage and driveway as well as the thatch in the lawn.   It pushes a large volume of air with enough force to move objects that other blowers can’t.,5

That's a huge amount, considering I'm mainly using it to fill car and motorcycle tires. It's not the end of the world, but it's annoying to have to figure out how many psi it's off, then adjust and fill my tires. 

The accessories it came with are pretty cheap too, the presta valve adapter broke after 10 uses.

5/6/2020,0880-20,M18™ Wet/Dry Vacuum (Bare Tool),"I use this vacuum everyday where I work and let me tell you, when the hose needs changed out good luck. You almost have to rip the hose out just so you can get a tool to twist the connector from the lock position or back to the lock position because it is so poorly designed. There is absolutely no room at all to get a grip on the connector to remove it accept a flimsy tab that does no good what so ever to remove the hose. The battery... oh boy it takes me a good 5 mins to just get it out because the grooves it slides I to is so tight that you have to apply pressure just to get the battery to fully seat correctly. Taking that battery out is the same issue. You have just barely enough room to put 4 fingers on the underside of the battery and then you can slowly pry the battery out. The battery is so tight the our night crew actually accuses us on days of super gluing the battery in place. Would I recommend to purchase this vacuum? Absolutely not. Horrible design horrible product execution and obviously the design wasnt tested properly for correct functions of battery and hose replacement. And yes the hoses rip very easy and the vacuums fail and stop working quickly as well. Get a different vacuum other that this you will regret the purchase of this vacuum.",1

The only thing I hate is the fact that the chain keeps coming off.  I have had to stop and put it back on at least 10 times now.  I think the bar is too flexible or something.

5/11/2020,2720-20,M18 FUEL™ SAWZALL® Reciprocating Saw (Tool Only),"I recently decided to update a few of my older ""orange"" cordless tools and decided to go with team red.  I was so impressed that I decided to update all my tools onto a single platform and have yet to be disappointed with any of them.  The Fuel SAWZALL is no different.

           : Smooth and firm keyless blade swap mechanism.  Strong negative spring action opens smoothly to allow blade insertion or release, and snaps back with firm tension so you know the blade is locked.
            : Heavy but well balanced.  Some might say this is a con, but a demo geared recip saw benefits from weight as down cuts become effortless and weight helps absorb the media vibration that is inherent with this type of cutting tool.
             : Fully adjustable hinged shoe that is extendable up to 2 inches. Why does this matter?  A recip saw should always cut with media against the shoe, when this area of the blade wears, you can extend the shoe to open up fresh sharp teeth to get double life out of a blade. (This is a feature that needs to be incorporated into their 1 handed cutter line /wink).
             : Plenty of power.  The variable trigger is very smooth and easy to control so the power doesn't get away from you.

Other thoughts:  it has a built in hangar to hang the tool from a rafter or hefty belt which could be handy if one needed that option. 
 It comes with the tough rubber cover that is an optional purchase on most of their other tools to protect the body because who's is nice.  Personally, I feel that these covers should be included on all of their fuel varients as the markup on the components is ridiculous if purchased separately.  After paying $250 for m12 ratchet, it almost seems sad that I am expected to pay another $30 for a formed piece of rubber to protect my investment which cost about $2 to manufacture.

Ample venting keeps unit cool.  One thought is the size of these vents will allow a lot of debris to get inside of housing but on the flip side, those same large openings will allow debris an easy portal of escaping the housing.  Risk vs benefit of this could be seen both ways.

Odd observation: the coloring on most of Milwaukees ""full size"" tools like this is almost orange when compared to the deep red of the smaller tools.  Not sure why, just something I noticed.",5

5/13/2020,48-22-8426,PACKOUT™ Rolling Tool Box,"The packout storage line has saved me tons of time. (Which in my eyes is $ and something I’ll never get back and see it to be very valuable.) For the size of the boxes you’d be surprised how much you can fit in each one if you organize you stuff right. Of course there’s some tools that don’t fit but for the most part it handles most things. I bought a number of the different sized clear top organizers for storing all my fasteners, nuts, bolt, holes saw bits, drill bits, rotohammer bits, ect. Much better than the system I had before. I had my gooseneck tounge come down on one of my organizer boxes  with a load of logs on it and the box still works as it should. And my big wheeled packout handle got caught between the bed rails of my truck and my gooseneck trailer and still totes my tools around every day with probably more weight than it should have.

This tool makes weed eating a pleasant experience. My other machine is a very popular gas powered brand that I've used for years. This cordless trimmer does the job 95% as good as that one does- without the engine maintenance, or the noise. I never realized how irritating small gas engines were till I worked in my yard without one. The unit is light, well balanced, and powerful enough for thick grass and even stemmy plants and small tree sprouts. The handle is a bit thick for my small hands, and I wish it came with a strap. But these complaints are insignificant next to the superiority of this excellent product. I have many Milwaukee brand tools, so I'm not really easily impressed.

Lots of power and as I said easy to control. This is not my first router, but clearly excellent, highly recommend.

I own or have owned nearly every stihl product ever released and stihl is what I’ve always used. I purchased the Milwaukee quick-lok weed eater, hand held hedge trimmer, and a 12.0 battery all at the same time. The weed eater has blown me away and I believe it holds its own against the stihl products but the hedge trimmer not so much. No question it is still a GREAT product BUT still doesn’t quite match what my stihl gas powered hedgers have to offer. It often gets stuck when trying to cut 3/4 caliper limbs where my gas powered cuts right through them. As a homeowner I believe the Milwaukee hedge trimmers are a great option but not quite there on the commercial side. They’re great for maintaining a property but not taking care of something that has been over grown for a season or so. I do love how they put off very little sound and weigh a fraction of gas powered hedgers. Also love the Capability of being able to grab it and immediately start trimming.",4

5/16/2020,2505-20,M12 FUEL™ Installation Drill/Driver,"I have a Bosch FlexiClick which I bought couple of years ago,  when current Milwaukee model was introduced in Europe and I wanted universal tool to not use my regular drill or impact. Bosch does it job well but just a thought,  that there is a tool out there which is better,  was always in my head. Finally Milwaukee introduced this installation driver to USA customers and I pulled the trigger. 
Love it. Easy head swinging system is a big improvement over Bosch's model. Actually this was my gripe about flexiclick model, whenever you hit the running head against the surface,  it unscrews itself from the driver and it became very annoying. Milwaukee doesn't have any problems plus another advantage is that you can stand the tool, I just don't like that I had no choice but lay it on a side when there is a dust or dirt on a surface and I had to mess my hands because of it. Some people are complaining about the frame which is on the way to get to the hard to rich points, but I haven't had any situations where it would restrict the access to any far corners of the cabinet or lighting. I find this front part handy for the embedded magnets in it.
 Regarding the top position switch... hmm..it sucks. Not in regard of functionality but I should be able to easily switch with my finger the direction of the driver. Actually this was the only thing what made me think about keeping this tool. If I would not have the passion for the Milwaukee I'd not keep it jut because of the top sided directional switch which I can't reach with my finger on the same hand. Stupid idea but it was implemented and we either take it or leave it. If there will be second generation with a better location of this switch,  I'll get the new one and wil give this one to my wife ))
Overall this is very nice tool and if you can live with knowing that you might have a situation where you would have to use another hand for switching the direction of the drill, or manage getting to the switch in awkward way, I would highly recommend this installation driver.  All in one which will last you a long time.",5

The friction ring anvil design is very bad. No matter what brand of socket you use (craftsman, husky or even snap-on), they all slide loosely on the anvil and are not held on tight in place. This if very annoying!
This tool should have come with the detent pin anvil design. Those work great.
If it had that kind of anvil (like other milwaukee power tools offer that option) then this would be the best gun ever.
Too bad the manufacturer is so ignorant and not willing to offer that option.",1

The chainsaw made short work of the tree, the only downside that I have found is that under continuous use the battery entered into a thermal lockdown mode, if Milwaukee could find a way to counteract that this saw would be perfect.

Every time the string wears down I have to stop, and remove the cap and draw out new string.  Sometime the string ends up wedged on itself and I have to pry it loose.  I eventually gave up, unwound all the string and rewound it per the manual's directions, the easy load seems to work great.  But same issue, it never feeds out.  So about a dozen times in a 20mins session, I end up stopping, removing the cap and manually feeding out some string out.  Turns a 30min job into over an hour.",1

After using this tool for about 3 months now it has become very irritating to use. It stalls out when using! It is not an issue of too much pressure applied, I have had it stall when using a scotch brite disc to polish a weld.

I see people complaining about it on forums but they are missing two really important things. 1) it performs better with a 4ah or better battery. 2) put a diablo saw blade on it! Every saw you ever buy will be junk if you don’t use a good blade. I’m sure the stock blade would be fine with the right battery but it cuts like butter with the diablo. It also lasts way longer than you’d expect a 12v circular saw to last. I have been through MAYBE 2 full battery cycles in over 2 weeks. I don’t use it a ton but it’s my go to for anything where the depth is appropriate.,5

This was 3 months ago. I haven't heard a word or received anything at all. I have reached out to them and have gotten no responses. I've apparently been ghosted now.,1

My biggest issues that I have with them is that after having used the set I have for the past year the grips have broken off and continue to slide off. I have actually lost the grips for one of my pairs. Second to that is the fact that if I am not holding them while drilling, which happens fairly often if the extrusion is long enough, the vibration of the drill has caused the clamp to unlock itself and fall to the floor. 

Great product overall, just be warned of the couple small flaws.",4

This system made sense as I move my tools between three different trucks dependent on the job. I have owned the dolly for around 90 days and a caster has already broken in its seat. It will not remain engaged in the dolly, and this dolly is used solely on finished concrete. Reinforcing the seats on the castors of the dolly to ensure that the casters not only engage but remain locked in would increase this rating to 4 stars, making off-road casters that could actually handle grass, well packed dirt, or the average construction site would make it a five star. I’m a believer in Milwaukee tools and use their M12, and M18 systems exclusively in some pretty tough conditions. Frankly, I expected better than this.",3

I was able to tighten a bolt then just hook it on my pocket with the clip and move on to the next fastener.,5

The battery charges from empty to half and then gives you a green light as if it's fully charged.   It isn't.  I've tried different chargers, I've tried pressing it into the charger further,  and I've tried running it completely dead and recharging and none of it allows it to charge over 50%.

5/17/2020,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","I bought this chainsaw for cutting down some small and medium size trees on a couple of our properties. The chainsaw itself has some weight to it. When I opened the box it was perfectly packaged, and fully assembled. However, it does NOT come with chain oil. Not even a small starter bottle. You’ll need to get the chain bar oil prior to using it first. The safety switch (large handle) works great however, it sounds like your breaking it when you take it off the safety. The electronic braking system stops the chain from moving almost immediately after you release the trigger which is fantastic for safety. I used it to cut down a 16-18 foot tree right away, and it worked flawlessly. It worked so well it was effortless. It basically pulled itself right thru the tree. The perfect part is it is so quite. I was cutting trees for roughly 1.5 hours on 1 12.0 battery and it still had all the lights on the battery. I would highly highly recommend this chainsaw to everyone.",5

After checking out the reviews and taking the leap of faith, I am super impressed with the tool. I am a little embarrassed to admit it's above my skill level!

As a test, I took off the lug nuts of my car faster with this driver than I could with my impact wrench. I install windows, and this driver has so much torque it often drives the screw completely before even needing to start impacting.",5

After reading reviews on both I decided to go with the m12 stubby and venture into the m12 line. No regrets at all. For such a small compact gun the torque is incredible. I use my m18 gun for lug nuts but have tried the stubby on them and it does it. If you already have m12 batteries it’s a no brainer. Even if you don’t, and have the m18 / m12 dual chargers it’s not that big of an investment. I have since added more m12 tools to my large collection of m18.",5

5/23/2020,2110-21,USB Rechargeable 700L Flashlight,The flashlight itself has a great output and it is made of good material. Have not had any issues with it other than it has 1 design flaw. When the bottom of the flashlight is closed up by the charging port there seems to be some kind of air pocket inside the unit that wont allow the beam focus to be changed from spot to flood. When you open the bottom part so the charging port is exposed the spot & flood beam focus stay in place...but when its closed you pull back the top of the light to put it in flood mode it bounces back to spot mode. The flashlight is supposed to be used with the bottom port closed so the charging port wont be exposed to dust & water. They need to design this so it can relieve the air pressure inside. when the bottom port is closed off. Other than that it works great so far.,4

I am a HVAC professional and have used this religiously for over 4 years in duct work installation and it has paid for itself many times over because I can do my work in a fraction of the time versus standard snips and no hand fatigue. I did break the blade once but it was my fault for cutting mutlti-layered sheet metal that I shouldn't have. I have nothing negative to say and honestly couldn't imagine ever working without it. Also one reviewer mentioned replacement blade cost as being astronomical which also wasn't my case. I don't remember exact price but as I recall was less than $100 and well worth it.

So for those of you who say it’s a weak ratchet might have just had a faulty one but keep in mind it has a warranty and the price is a fraction of the well known brands. And lastly Milwaukee is a power tool company so that’s even more impressive that their 3/8” drive ratchet took the top spot for strongest 3/8” drive ratchets.",5

When it comes to automotive/mechanical repairs, etc, it’s the little fasteners that are to most time consuming to remove/install.  This wrench absolutely shines in this area...any place you would typically use a 1/4” drive ratchet.  Don’t expect it to remove lug nuts...but it does have a lot of power (85 ft lbs fastening/100 ft lbs breaking torque).

Also, I definitely recommend getting a CP 3.0 or XC 6.0 battery for it...seems like these make a big difference in power output compared to the regular CP 2.0 batteries.",5

But the negative is very bad.

Besides this pad is unesesary, simply use a reverse cut blade.

The first, and probably the last, time I used it was to cut out for registers in new wood floor. I managed with difficulty, and have one visible cut because you can't see the blade, and ended up cutting too long.

5/20/2020,48-11-1890,M18™ REDLITHIUM™ HIGH DEMAND™ 9.0 Battery Pack,"Good tools Bad battery
Purchased this battery one year ago with M18 Pole Saw and String Trimmer. First Milwaukee purchase. Mostly buy Makita but liked the Milwaukee pole saw design. On the plus side, the tools themselves are really good. Have taken down/cut up whole medium size trees with the pole saw while chainsaw sat idle on the wagon. And the trimmer has become a surprising favorite - great power. Both tools also had very productive run times before needing recharge. But now the run times are down about 75%. The battery charger says the battery is fully charged, the battery indicator lights say 3 out of 4, the actual run time says maybe 1/4 charged. Used these tools less than 20x, battery always charged/stored in proper temperature. As I am new to Milwaukee platform I do not have any other red batteries on hand (plenty of blue ones, all of which work great!) so I guess there is a lesson there. Looking at other reviews, looks like this battery is just a bad design or something. It is really too bad because the tools themselves are well designed, well made and perform above expectations; I would highly recommend them except they're not much use without a working battery.",1

I was interested in switching from air the battery operated, but was hesitant. I was concerned about the power and the battery life. After a test run of borowing one from a friend I was hooked. This tool has all the power of a typical 1/4 inch air rachet. Battery life is pretty good, does not always last a whole day. However I'm using it 10 hours a day. One of the best features is not tripping over and dragging an air hose. This tool has increased my productivity as well.

5/24/2020,2782-20,M18 FUEL™ Metal Cutting Circular Saw (Tool Only),I bought this saw to put metal siding on an outbuilding that I had. I knew that the sheets were a challenge to cut because of the ribs in them and was not sure what to use. I thought I would use an abrasive wheel or turn a saw blade around backwards. After reading that abrasive wheels create heat that it burns the paint and causes rust that I didn't want to do that. Also a friend of mine said that he had turned a saw blade backward but it threw metal shavings everywhere I didn't want to go that route. We have one of these saws at work and cut a lot thicker stuff that metal siding so I thought I would give it a try. This thing cuts like a hot knife through butter. The edges are smooth and the metal is not hot. Also it is shielded so that it doesn't throw chips everywhere. This saw is not all that  big but it tackles a big job and made a difficult job a lot easier.,5

Also the color of the light produced is great for identifying wire colors. Some other lights have a very blue LED and it makes it very difficult to identify wires. It is very rugged.

Sure, others may be a bit more cost effective immediately but when you need a tool to function as it should because you are 100 miles from anywhere to get another, that’s when the bargain tool usually lets you down.

While I was out working on the sprinklers I kept hearing this noise. When I come around the corner she’s got the hedge trimmer and she is trimming all of her boxwood hedges. So if I can get a tool that somebody else is willing to pick up and trim and do the yard work it is a great tool. But when I finally got a hold of it to do the higher stuff I was very impressed how it would trim through half inch branches. The only disappointment. Is that I’m not a professional landscaper and I don’t use this tool every day. But I know once here when I need it I will have a good tool to use around my yard.,5

I had made sure it was fully charged before I used it.  When it quit I put back on the charger and it  immediately showed 3 full bars and was charged completely in 5 minutes. I tried it again with the same results. I concluded there was something wrong with the electronics of the battery.  The battery is still under warranty according to the manual but I pitched the purchase paperwork because it had worked good for a couple years.

The power is excellent, it is lightweight and has a magnetic holder on the front. 
The button is easy to reach with your thumb while holding the drill (if you're holding it correctly for this style)
What I HATE about it is that it will not standup on it's own when you but it down with a ""Real"" battery in it, real bettery being an M12 4Ah or 6Ah. Milwaukee needs to include a small plastic addon that clips to the lower fron of the drill for using the larger batteries, so it can stand up when you put it down.",5

It is a curious omission. I can't think of another miter saw that I have used that didn't have a depth stop. Was a feature I didn't even consider when I bought this saw, because it seemed so standard to me that I expected it to be there. Is even even odder that the Milwaukee M18 10"" miter saw has a depth stop, while the 7-1/4 does not.

I have pondered making my own depth stop for the saw. Almost looks to me like it was originally engineered with the capability in mind, when I look at the castings.

Once the tree was on the ground it flew through cutting up all the smaller stuff to about 14"". Went through 4 batteries and almost completely filled a truck bed full of wood.

5/27/2020,2558-20,"M12 FUEL™ 1/2"" Ratchet (Tool Only)","This 1/2” ratchet was the first Milwaukee cordless tool I purchased.  It convinced me to change from yellow to red.  While the tool and battery combination is a but on the heavy side, if you position it correctly, that weight can easily be used in your favor.  The ratchet is built like a tank and I have no doubt that it will outlast me as long as the battery lasts.  My experience with the yellow brand has jaded me slightly regarding the newer generation of lithium  batteries.  Thus far though, the Milwaukee batteries have impressed my socks off.  I charged the battery when the tool arrived.  Since then, I have used the ratchet a solid 43 hours and there is still no need to recharge in sight.  So far, I have used the ratchet rebuilding my riding lawnmower, servicing both of my trucks, and working on my tractor.  This 1/2” ratchet has no problem punching above its weight by using a 1/2 to 3/4 drive adapter so I can use it with my 3/4 drive sockets, including some very large sizes on the tractor.  One thing I think I have to add to this review is that I have never been the type to be married to a brand for all of my cordless tools.  I have found that my precious money was always best spent my buying the best tool I could afford for the job at hand.  If I needed a drill/driver, I bought the best one I could afford.  If I needed a saw, same thing, I’d buy the best one I could afford that would meet my needs.  Until now, I haven’t found one brand that I could rely on to fill every need.

It has never once giving me any problems other than the rocker switch getting a little stiff switching from off to low heat, but was likely due to it's addiction to free falling out of careless hands! (No fault of the tool). The switch worked itself back out somehow and is still working exactly as well as it did the first day I bought it! My Milwaukee heat gun is slightly cosmetically different than the one advertised, but that is just because it's the model before the new look, but the specs are the same and I would imagine Milwaukee has improved on this model if anything, so I definitely recommend this to professionals!",5

5/29/2020,48-22-8546,"46"" High Capacity Steel Storage Combo","This was a big purchase and I'm happy to report it was worth every penny. I had a 42"" Kobalt box that had served me incredibly well but I had outgrown it. Tools on top of tools. And while I didn't realize it until I got this box, the 18"" depth of my previous box had a lot to do with stuff stacked on top of other tools.

Like most everyone I researched and researched and came close on a couple other boxes but ultimately landed on this one and I'm so glad I did. My dad has the previous version and it's been a good box for him so that made the decision easier. 

It's heavy, and that's a good thing, but make arrangements for getting it unloaded. Thankfully I've got access to a FEL with forks so that made it easy, but if you're manhandling it you'll want at least 2 strong adults, preferably 3. This thing is STOUT.

Assembly is easy and pretty intuitive. One thing I appreciate is that you get EVERYTHING....liners, accessories, all of it. No nickel and dime stuff after the fact. If you've never had 22"" deep drawers you're going to love it. Can't overstate the difference it makes. 

This chest has ample power tool storage but it's primarily designed for hand tools. Just know that going in. It's been a total game-changer for me getting organized and I have zero regrets on this purchase.",5

So when you are cutting sides you have to slow down and makes them feel heavy. With gas im moving faster swinging up and down , so less fatigue when cutting so much. Weight feels about the same as my stihl bg 56 or my corded stihl fse 70. If you have less to trim you’ll love these. they are quiet also.",4

The one-finger opener is much safer and slicker (IMO) even if somewhat less ""flashy"" than flip-open models. 

This required NO break-in period. It just worked perfectly from day 1. 

The shape of the handle is good for the grip... secure, comfortable.

The blade is relatively easy to sharpen and takes a fine edge. I've only had to sharpen the serrations once, and that is best done with round fine diamond file. 

My first one of these is about a year old now, and I've used it hundreds of times for cutting rope, boxes, opening packages, digging into wood around nails and screws. It still works perfectly.

This tool stood out for a few reasons. It has the most impact energy and a full vibration control system. This allowed me to get work done quickly while saving my joints from vibration. With having the extra blow energy for its size you can get in close for detail tile demo while not having a cord get in the way. If you have a couple good sized high output batteries and a quick charger you will not run out of power cycling batteries. overall I think this is a great addition for lighter work demo and drilling anchor holes while keeping your hands protected so they work in your later years. On a side note, I ran a large demo hammer with no vibration control and wore the Milwaukee demo gloves. These gloves really helped with vibration too.

I also used it to build a 6 foot cedar patio table for my deck and turned out beautiful. The corded skil with a new blade burned the end of a 4x4 but when I switched to the Milwaukee it cut through it like it was butter. The saw is a little on the heavy side with the battery but comparable to a my corded saw which is small smaller in size.  I found the LED light very handy and has other features to allow for bevel cuts at various angles. I found them to be accurate when I measured with my protractor. Well, its off to goodwill for skil.

By far the worst thing is that the battery has a constant drain when the switch is on - whether it is charging something or not. Meaning a High Output XC6.0 battery can only charge my older phone about 3-4 times if I turn it on overnight. The battery has enough energy capacity to charge the phone 9-10 times - IF it was programmed better (like every other battery bank in this price range).",2

This saw maybe best used for for trimming, cutting logs for splitting, or carving.

5/29/2020,2902-20,"M18 1/2"" Brushless Hammer Drill (Tool Only)","I got this drill with a combination set a few months ago because the tools look more rugged than other brands of tools.  I have used this drill on several occasions in wood and metal, and have also used it as a power screw driver in both heavy duty and light duty situations with no trouble.  A few days ago, I was rebuilding a damaged swingset and was tightening some loose screws when the drill just stopped.  The battery was still half charged, but pulling the trigger didn't do anything.  I took off the battery and reconnected it and pulled the trigger, but even though the small light was lighting up, the drill was still not working.  In a few seconds, the light would go off despite me still working the trigger, as though it was no longer getting current.  Whether tapping on the housing, pulling the trigger, or disconnecting and reconnecting the battery, it still doesn't work.  I assume that the trigger has somehow lost connection inside the housing.  If I take a tool apart, I usually cannot get it back together, so I'll purchase a replacement drill and hope it is better.  If it's not, I may have to look at other options.

I took it back to Home Depot where I purchased it, they exchanged it (A+ for customer service BTW), and right out of the box the new one was just as bad. I assume there was a bad batch of these, because I don't think Milwaukee would knowingly drop the ball like this. I really want this tool, and was excited to see they have a straight die grinder too now, bit I'm really hesitant to try it at the moment, or at least until they figure out this motor issue.",1

This tool did not last a year and ruined two of my batteries. Now the tool is loose at the head where it meets body don't use it anymore would look else where for a multi tool.,1

I used the saw to cut back over 30 trees with diameters between 1 inch all the way up to 14 inches. Saw is a beast and battery life is amazing. I only gave 4 stars due to the bar/chain oiler.

I got the kit with the 2 batteries. Makes under 10 cuts then the battery overheats and won’t run anymore.

I have to admit at a quick glance they do look similar. I didn't notice it was the radio until I had removed it from the box. I showed it to my wife and we had a good laugh. I put it back in the box and was going to return it the following weekend because we are 35 miles away from our closest home depot, so while it was riding around in my van with me my curiosity got the best of me so I plugged it in at my shop, turned it on, tuned it in, adjusted the equalizer and what amazing sound came from the speakers. I decided to keep it. I hope this isn't a bad decision after read all the bad revues. And yes I was thinking It would be nice to have bluetooth plus a usb input and a sd card slot. The radio I have been using for three years and still works is a cheap China radio that has all these options that I purchased on ebay for $70.00 at least I have a back up if this Milwaukee radio gives problems.

It has a lot of power, fast startup to full speed and a quick stop of the blade when the cut is finished. It is nicely balanced, has easy adjustments for blade depth and angle cuts. The LED shines right on the cutting area for better precision cuts. Not too heavy but it feels real solid. I think am going to enjoy this for years to come.",5

It seems fully capable for moving grass and leaves.  The 6.0 and 8.0 A/hr batteries seem to give the best balance, the 12.0 is a bit back heavy and I don't need the extra time.  I like that it has 2 speeds and a variable trigger switch.  It helps when you don't want a tornado to move things.  I think the variable switch could be better, but these have a tendency to fail if not done right.  I would also like to see an accessory for blowing up various things, air mattress, pool rafts, etc.",5

6/7/2020,2426-20,M12™ Cordless Multi-Tool (Tool Only),"Great tool for getting into tight spaces and making precise cuts. I’ve used this to remove drywall and straighten cuts, cutting wood, cutting through nails that are in the way for running ducts, cutting tile and removing grout. Love it for all these applications and grateful to have it as part of the arsenal of tools. The tool itself is lightweight depending on the size battery you slap on it. Variable speeds for adjusting to the material you are dealing with and how precise you want to be. My only negative is sometimes the m12 batteries are a bit difficult to take out, but then again this can be seen as a pro because the vibration from the tool will not disconnect the battery from the tool.",5

6/7/2020,0880-20,M18™ Wet/Dry Vacuum (Bare Tool),I enjoy using this vac because its ability to take it anywhere I need it from remote sites without power being available to cleaning out nooks and crannies between equipment that traditional vacs don’t reach easily. My crew uses this vac religiously when performing preventative maintenance to add onto the quality experience for patrons visiting our facilities. I appreciate it when even the nooks and crannies have been cleaned out for a finished look and message that you care about the finer details.,4

I appreciate it being better for my hearing for not being as loud and for the ability to be able to use it in an active office setting without being too disruptive.

6/6/2020,2760-20,"M18 FUEL™ SURGE™ 1/4"" Hex Hydraulic Driver (Tool Only)","This is by far my favorite purchase from the Milwaukee lineup. The high setting (3) zips fasteners right to the boards, and the low setting (1) snugs fasteners perfectly without stripping or snapping screws. Haven't noticed much of a difference when starting Screws using the self tapping setting compared to using the high (3) setting. The ONLY setback that I've experienced is the collet. The speedy quick connect design is convenient but after maybe 20 (non-abusive) uses, occasionally the collet will not keep the bit in place. The driver is still usable, it's just very frustrating to have to chase bits falling out of the collet when you're trying to get your project put together. All in all, great tool and I would recommend to any builder/handyman [with hopes of an upgraded collet in the works from Milwaukee]",3

I also have the high torque 1/2 inch and that is not strong enough for the majority of the big bolts that I interact with. For everything under the hood though I go strait to the stubby. Its quick small and just as powerful as my coworkers older generations of Milwaukee 3/8 drive. I would recommend getting at least one bigger battery for any larger projects.

It's really not being over worked, over heated, etc.  You pull the trigger and the blade will start and rotate 2 or 3 times then stop.  Eventually it just stops working altogether.  For the money paid it should work much better.  My neighbor's Dewalt ran all day and picked up the slack when the Milwaukee died.  Brought it inside for several hours just in case it over heated...no dice.  I can't see investing in Milwaukee products if they are going to die in under a year and with minimal usage.

I’ve always been a big fan of Milwaukee products but I am very disappointed with these items.

6/7/2020,2825-20ST,M18 FUEL™ String Trimmer w/ QUIK-LOK™,I purchased the combo kit last month from home depot only to use it for about a hour. Worked great the first time i used it. Next day i went to use it with a fully charged battery that came with it and it would only run for about 2-5 minutes then stop on its own. Let go of the trigger and hit it again to only work a few seconds or maybe a couple minutes again. I returned it and picked up another one to deal with the same thing yet again. It runs all day long no issues at all with my hedge trimmer and edger attachments just not the string trimmer. 2/2 so id highly suggest avoiding it unless you want it for the other attachment use.,1

6/7/2020,2766-20,M18 FUEL™ High Torque ½” Impact Wrench with Pin Detent (Tool Only),As an auto and heavy machine mobile mechanic I need something that doesn't need to be hooked up to an air hose or plug in but also has the torque required to break loose the biggest bolts and nuts. I have the best impacts and sometimes I still need to use a large breaker bar to get the initial turn. Hundreds of jobs with this impact and my breaker bar is just sitting collecting dust in the truck. Great tool.

We can get the in much tighter places and the torque is amazing! With the new 6amp hour battery we can go all day without having to Change batteries. I also bought the 1/2” Milwaukee impact which is awesome too but we don’t use it as much as anticipated because the “Stubby 3/8” has way more power than anticipated! Buy one you will not be sorry!

I have to make one cut with the multi-tool and the battery kept coming out. I tried all three of my batteries. By the time I am done making my simple cut there are black shavings in the tool and on the batteries. Two of the batteries the latches had the plastic melted/stripped. I ended up using electrical tape to tape the dang battery on just so I could make one simple cut. So now I have two batteries compromised on my brand new set I didn’t even have for 24 hours. I returned the saw on Monday. Not too happy and it was pretty embarrassing in front of my client.,1

6/4/2020,48-22-8200,Jobsite Backpack,This backpack checks most of the boxes with features with the only deficiency for my application being the lack of a metal tape measure clip but the quality of the zippers and plastic clasps is not so good. The zipper on mine for the main tool storage compartment has come out of sync and now I always have it popping open along the bottom edge because the zipper doesn't line up. I've also had several of the plastic clasps break which has necessitated tying up the straps. As I stated in the title this tool bag is highly recommended based on features alone but I am reluctant to recommend it based on the zippers and clasps. With an upgrade to the these two items and the addition of a tape measure clip I would easily reconsider my rating and would absolutely recommend it to everyone in the trades.,3

I don't like that the variable speed is trigger controlled.Trying to hold the trigger at what you think is a certain RPM can be tiring. It would be better with a dial to control the speed, then just pull and lock the trigger. Or make a One Key model that allows for speed customization through the app. If you're on the fence, maybe hold off until that happens.",3

6/3/2020,2111-21,USB Rechargeable Hard Hat Headlamp,After 2 months of use after about 30 minutes on the low setting the light flashes on and off then dies shortly after. Then I go to charge it and the led on the headlamp flashes red for a little bit the flashes green. It’s almost useless and just frustrates me at best. After months of research on which headlamp I thought I would want for work I’m disappointed that this was my final product. On the upside I like the lighting option of being able to turn it on and off without having to go through 6 lighting modes,1

6/3/2020,2727-21HD,"M18 FUEL™ 16"" Chainsaw Kit","This saw has been a great tool for clearing trees off my parents' property.  My dad broke his hip last fall shortly after buying a house and property damaged by Hurricane Michael. I've used this saw to both fell trees and also to cut up trees that were already down.  It has been used on construction jobs to cut 4x4 and 6x6 posts to length and was very convenient for that as well.  The battery life is very good with an 8.0 HO battery and the saw hasn't bogged down yet.  I love that all I have to do is add bar oil to this saw.  No more mixing fuel.  I still have my gas saw, but this is the one I turn to every time now.",5

6/3/2020,2456-21,"M12™ Cordless 1/4"" Lithium-Ion Ratchet Kit","I'm trying to understand how, that in all my years working on cars that I made it without this cordless ratchet. Its the newest addition to my newly built collection of the red and black, and as a new reviewer to the brand, I have been so impressed with all the other tools I own or have tried recently from milwaukee, I dont think I'm venturing out very far. Tool is balance, feels good in the hand. Not too heavy, but no cheap light plastics. Rubber grips very well in the hand. Has good power, mind you though... this is not a breaker bar, or an impact wrench. The nut first needs to be cracked, once then, when your trying to remove a fastener in a deep tight spot barely 2 clicks at a time, those 9 seconds will play into your overall job efficiency.. with acute arthritis in the hands, and bad joints from lymes, trust my saying this...
Anyway, with that said. This is and awesome tool, that is solid and built to last but also to do the job. Dont think on it too much, 10/10 recommendED.

Keep it up!
